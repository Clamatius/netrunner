Corp cards of note:

**Urtica Cipher:** The only advanceable trap in the format.
- 2 + [counters] net damage
- 2 counters = 4 damage. 3 counters = 5 damage.

**Bran Cipher:** The biggest ICE in the format.
- Bioroid with 2 ETRs and 1 annoying sub. 8 to full-break with Cleaver.

**Whitespace:** Annoying code gate. Can be beaten without decoder by having $10+

**Karuna:** Potentially deadly sentry. 
- 2 damage, then you can jack out if you want, then 2 more
- Sometimes 4 damage is worth winning the game to access, but if the card is advanced you may flatline on Cipher
