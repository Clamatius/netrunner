## Key Analysis

### Q1: Can the Runner contest Server 1?

**No Killer = Brân is a wall.**

Runner has Cleaver (fracter) and Unity (decoder), but no killer. Brân is a Barrier, so Cleaver breaks it... but look at the cost:

| Method | Clicks | Credits | Total Cost |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| Click through (3 subs) | 3 | $0 | 3 clicks + 1 run = 4 clicks (entire turn!) |
| Break with Cleaver | 1 | $8 | Boost $6 (3→6 str) + break $2 (2 uses) |

Runner has $7. They literally cannot afford to break Brân with Cleaver ($8 needed).

**Conclusion:** Server 1 is safe this turn. Even clicking through costs their entire turn.

### Q2: What's the HQ risk?

**Send a Message in HQ is a liability.**

If Runner runs HQ instead of contesting remotes:
- Palisade costs $2 to break (Cleaver: $0 boost, $1 break)
- 1 in 5 chance to access Send a Message = instant 3 points for Runner

| HQ Size | SaM Access Risk |
|---------|-----------------|
| 5 cards | 20% |
| 4 cards | 25% |
| 6 cards | 17% |
| 7 cards | 14% |

**More cards in HQ = better protection for Send a Message.**

### Q3: How do choices affect risk?

**Don't play Hedge Fund!**

| Action | HQ After | SaM Risk | Notes |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| Hedge Fund | 4 cards | 25% | WORSE - removes a card |
| Install from HQ | 4 cards | 25% | Neutral if we install something |
| Credit | 5 cards | 20% | Keeps sandbags |
| Install + Install | 3 cards | 33% | Much worse! |

The key insight: **cards in HQ are shields for Send a Message**.

## Optimal Line

**Click 1:** Install Superconducting Hub in Server 1 (behind Brân)
**Click 2:** Install Nico Campaign in Server 2
**Click 3:** Take 1 credit ($12 total)

**Why this works:**

1. **Hub is protected.** Runner can't afford to break Brân, clicking through costs 4 clicks total.

2. **If Hub scores next turn:**
   - Gain 1 point (Corp to 4)
   - Draw 2 cards (HQ goes from 3 → 5)
   - SaM now 1 in 5 instead of 1 in 3

3. **Nico in Server 2 is a tempo test:**
   - If they trash it ($3), they're down to $4, can't threaten Brân at all
   - If they ignore it, you gain $9 over 3 turns
   - Either way, you win the exchange

4. **Credit instead of Hedge Fund:**
   - Keeps HQ at 3 cards (after 2 installs)
   - $12 is plenty to advance Hub next turn
   - Don't need $15 right now

**Next turn:** Advance Hub 3 times, score. Draw 2. Now at 4 points with a fuller hand protecting SaM.

## Wrong Lines

### The "Just Jam SaM" Trap

Install Send a Message in Server 1, advance, advance.
- SaM at 2 advancements, needs 3 more
- Takes 2 more turns to score
- Runner has time to find a Killer
- Meanwhile HQ has only 4 cards protecting nothing critical

### The "Hedge Fund First" Trap

Hedge Fund ($15), install Hub, advance.
- HQ drops to 3 cards
- If Runner checks HQ, 33% to steal SaM
- The $4 net gain doesn't help this turn

### The "All-In Bluff" Trap

Install Urtica in Server 1, advance, advance.
- Runner must check (you're at 3 points)
- They eat 4 damage (2 base + 2 from advancements)
- But now you have no trap threat remaining
- Brân alone doesn't protect real agendas long-term

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **HQ cards are armor.** Every card in hand reduces agenda access probability.

2. **Score the small agenda first.** Hub is 3/1, easy to score behind Brân. SaM is 5/3, needs a real remote or Seamless Launch.

3. **Don't spend cards you don't need to.** Hedge Fund gains credits but costs a card from HQ.

4. **Create lose-lose for Runner.** Nico in an empty remote: trash it (tempo loss) or let it fire (econ advantage).

5. **Brân without a Killer is a 4-click tax.** That's the whole Runner turn. Abuse this window.
