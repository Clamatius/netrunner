# Answer: turn1-002-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Resource assessment:**
- 3 clicks, 5 credits
- Economy: Government Subsidy (needs 6 credits - can't play!)
- ICE: Brân (rez 6), Karunā (rez 4), Diviner (rez 2)
- Agenda: Send a Message (3/1) - key card here
- Fast advance: Seamless Launch (not useful without remote)

**The blessing:**
No agenda flood. We have ICE. The hand is weak but workable.

**The key insight:**
Send a Message gives free ICE rez when scored OR stolen. Brân costs 6 to rez - we can't afford that normally. But if we have Brân on the board when Send a Message fires, we get a free 6-credit rez. That's the out.

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Protect where you need to" - centrals first
- Send a Message sacrifice pattern - trade 1 point for massive tempo

**The turn:**
Use all 3 clicks productively. Install ICE, don't click for credits.

## Answer
```
1. Install Diviner protecting HQ
2. Install Karunā protecting R&D
3. Install Brân 1.0 on Server 1 (new remote)
```

**Why this line:**
- Diviner on HQ (cheap, 2 rez, punishes HQ pressure)
- Karunā on R&D (4 rez, 4 net damage potential, jack out option baits second sub)
- Brân on remote (can't rez it, but it's *on the board* for Send a Message)

**Next turn:**
Draw, hope for economy. If we get Hedge Fund, we can start playing real Netrunner. If not, we may need to Send a Message gambit - naked install it, let Runner steal, free Brân rez.

## Notes
- Seamless Launch doesn't help score Send a Message much (3/1 needs 3 advancements, Seamless gives 2, still need 1 more + install turn)
- Gov Subsidy needs us at 6 credits - we need to draw into Hedge Fund or click up
- The "do nothing" answer (click for credits) is worse than getting ICE down

## Common Mistakes
- Clicking for credits instead of installing ICE (wastes the turn)
- Trying to play Government Subsidy (costs 6, have 5)
- Not recognizing Send a Message + Brân synergy
- Putting Brân on a central (can't rez it anyway, wastes the gambit setup)
