# Answer: turn1-001-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Resource assessment:**
- 3 clicks, 5 credits
- 2x Whitespace (code gate, 2 rez), 1x Palisade (barrier, 2 rez)
- 1 economy, 1 agenda (4/2), 1 trap

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Get economy online and ICE on R&D" (Early game priority)
- "Protect where you need to... don't protect where you don't"
- Hedge Fund is best Turn 1 play (4 net credits)

**ICE analysis:**
Whitespace is excellent Turn 1. Runner starts at 5 credits. If they facecheck:
- Lose 3 credits → down to 2
- Fewer than 6? → ETR

Double Whitespace on centrals punishes early pressure hard.

**Scoring outlook:**
No great early line for the 4/2. Offworld needs 4 advancements - can't fast-advance, signals heavily. Focus on centrals Turn 1, set up remote Turn 2.

## Answer
```
1. Install Whitespace protecting R&D
2. Install Whitespace protecting HQ
3. Play Hedge Fund (9 credits)
```

**Turn 2 plan (if runner passive, draw is meh):**
→ Install Palisade on new remote
→ Install Offworld Office behind it
→ Advance

This sets up a potential score if runner doesn't contest. Palisade gets +2 strength on remote (becomes 4 str).

## Notes
- Order within turn doesn't matter much credit-wise
- "ice, ice, hedge fund" is the standard opener for a reason
- Holding Palisade for remote is good - it's stronger there (+2 str)
- Urtica stays in hand for later bluff potential

## Common Mistakes
- Installing agenda in naked remote Turn 1 (too risky)
- Clicking for credits when Hedge Fund is available
- Using Palisade on central (wastes the +2 str remote bonus)
- Fixed scripting without considering Turn 2 setup
