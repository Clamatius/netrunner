# Answer: mull-001-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Hand composition check:**
- Economy: Hedge Fund (strong opener - net +4 credits)
- ICE: Palisade (cheap barrier, rez 3), Whitespace (cheap code gate, rez 2)
- Threat: Urtica Cipher (trap), Offworld Office (economy agenda)

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Get economy online and ICE on R&D" - Have both
- ICE diversity: Barrier + Code Gate covers two types
- Economy: Hedge Fund is best Turn 1 play
- Threat projection: Can install ICE + agenda/trap Turn 1

**Turn 1 line available:**
1. Hedge Fund (+4 net, now at 9 credits)
2. Install Palisade on R&D
3. Install Whitespace on HQ OR install Urtica in remote

This hand enables immediate tempo: economy, central protection, and remote threat option.

## Answer
**KEEP**

## Notes
- Offworld is a 4/2 - can't fast-advance, requires visible advancement to score
- Both ICE are cheap to rez (Palisade 3, Whitespace 2), affordable after Hedge Fund
- Urtica in remote is a classic bluff that protects future agenda installs

## Common Mistakes
- Mulling for "better" economy when Hedge Fund is already optimal
- Wanting more ICE when two is sufficient for Turn 1
- Not recognizing the trap + agenda flexibility
