# Answer: mull-001-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Hand composition check:**
- Economy: Hedge Fund (strong opener - 4 net credits)
- ICE: Ice Wall (cheap barrier, 1 to rez), Enigma (cheap code gate, 3 to rez)
- Threat: Urtica Cipher (trap), Offworld Office (economy agenda)

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Get economy online and ICE on R&D" - Have both
- ICE diversity: Barrier + Code Gate covers two types
- Economy: Hedge Fund is best Turn 1 play
- Threat projection: Can install ICE + agenda/trap Turn 1

**Turn 1 line available:**
1. Hedge Fund (+4 net)
2. Install Ice Wall on R&D
3. Install Enigma on HQ OR install Urtica in remote

This hand enables immediate tempo: economy, central protection, and remote threat with one more ice.

## Answer
**KEEP**

## Notes
- Offworld is a 4/2 - can't fast-advance, requires visible advancement to score. Jamming it early is risky; any anti-ICE trick takes it. Accept that HQ is vulnerable until remote established.
- Sequencing within turn (Ice Ice Hedge vs Hedge Ice Ice) doesn't matter credit-wise, both end at 9.

## Common Mistakes
- Mulling for "better" economy when Hedge Fund is already optimal
- Wanting more ICE when two is sufficient for Turn 1
- Not recognizing the trap + agenda flexibility
