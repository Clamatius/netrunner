# Answer: mull-004-runner

## Expected Reasoning

**Hand composition check:**
- Economy: Overclock only (temporary, run-dependent)
- Breakers: Complete suite! (Cleaver x2, Carmen, Unity)
- Duplicate: Second Cleaver is dead draw

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Every card costs ~2 clicks... Every card must provide more than 2 clicks of value" - Duplicate Cleaver fails this
- "1 click → 1 credit = BAD (basic action, last resort)" - Without economy, forced into this
- "When poor (< 5 credits): Play economy, use installs or draw for it"

**Turn 1-2 projection:**
Starting credits: 5
- Run archives
- Install Carmen (5 credits, -2 for successful run)
- Click for credit → 3 credits
- Click for credit → 4 credits

Now have a single breaker but no economy. Can't afford to run through rezzed ICE. Unity and Cleaver are only 1 less, so we could install those... but then what? If we draw, and hit Sure Gamble, we can't even play it.

**Mulligan odds:**
- Need: Economy cards (Sure Gamble, Daily Casts, etc.)
- Deck has: ~10 economy cards
- Complete rig is rare but useless without money

**The trap:**
This hand *looks* strong (full breaker suite!) but leads to poor position. Breakers without credits can't break ICE.

## Answer
**MULLIGAN** (snap mull - you don't want to play any of these cards Turn 1)

## If Stuck With This Hand

Draw and pray for economy. You're in trouble.

Discard priority (if forced):
- Keep ONE Cleaver (might need it)
- Be willing to discard things you'd rather keep
- Fishing for Sure Gamble or any economy card

## Common Mistakes
- Keeping because "I have all breakers" (can't use them without credits)
- Underestimating economy importance
- Not recognizing duplicate Cleaver as wasted card
- Overclock looks like economy but requires running (which requires credits to break ICE beyond the 5 temporary)
