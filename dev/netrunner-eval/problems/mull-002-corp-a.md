# Answer: mull-002-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Hand composition check:**
- Economy: Government Subsidy (requires 6 credits - UNPLAYABLE, have 5)
- ICE: Brân 1.0 (6 to rez - can't rez Turn 1 even with clicking for credits)
- Agendas: THREE agendas (4 points total) - agenda flood

**The verdict:**
None of these cards are playable Turn 1. This is one of the worst possible hands.

**Playbook concepts:**
- "The draw spiral... HQ fills with agendas and Runner farms it" - This IS agenda flood
- "1 click = 1 credit. If this is your turn, something went wrong" - It's all we can do

**Turn 1 reality:**
- Click for credit × 3
- Result: 8 credits, empty board, 3 agendas in HQ, 2 more in R&D

Runner Turn 1: Run HQ → likely steals. Game is already losing.

## Answer
**MULLIGAN**

## Desperation Line (if you mull into this again)

**Send a Message gambit:**
1. Install Brân on R&D (can't rez, but scary)
2. Install Send a Message naked in remote
3. Click for credit

Hope: Runner steals Send a Message → free Brân rez (worth 6 credits).

You're down 0-1 but now have a rezzed Brân protecting R&D. It's an out. The sacrifice pattern applied to desperation - trading 1 agenda point for massive tempo swing. Still need a miracle, but at least you have a game.

## Common Mistakes
- Keeping because "Brân is good" (true, but unplayable position)
- Keeping because "agendas are what I need to win" (need to score them, not hold them)
- Thinking there's a decision here (there isn't - this is a snap mull)
