# Answer: turn1-004-runner

## Expected Reasoning

**Critical observation:**
Corp Turn 1 was VERY strange. They:
- Installed a card in a remote (no advancement)
- Clicked for credit twice
- Installed NO ICE anywhere

This is likely a misplay. Punish it.

**What's in the remote?**
- Asset: Probably economy (Regolith, Nico Campaign)
- Trap: Urtica Cipher at 0 advancement = 2 net damage
- Agenda: Probably 3/1, but could be 4/2 with Seamless Launch in hand

**The key insight:**
No ICE anywhere = run EVERYTHING. Free accesses on R&D and HQ too.

**Sequencing:**
Sure Gamble FIRST. Why?
- If the remote is a trap, we take 2 net damage
- Net damage = random discard from hand
- If Sure Gamble is in hand, we might lose it
- Playing it first: can't lose it, and we have 9 credits for trash costs

## Answer
```
1. Sure Gamble (9 credits - protects against losing it to damage)
2. Run Server 1 (check the remote)
   - Trap: take 2 damage, survivable
   - Asset: trash it, if it presents a serious threat only (have credits)
   - Agenda: steal it
3. Run R&D (free access, might hit agenda)
4. Run HQ (free access, might hit agenda)
```

**Why this aggressive?**
Corp made a mistake (no ICE on centrals). We have 4 clicks and 0 ICE to break. Run everything.

## Common Mistakes
- Running remote before Sure Gamble (might lose Sure Gamble to trap damage)
- Only running the remote ("free accesses on centrals too!")
- Conservative play (Smartware, draw, etc.) when Corp is wide open
- Fearing the trap when you have 5 cards and 9 credits

## Key Insight
Corp misplayed. When opponent makes a mistake, punish it immediately. 3 free accesses Turn 1 is massive. Even if the remote is a trap, you still get R&D and HQ for free.
