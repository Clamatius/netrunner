# Answer: yomi-001-corp

## The Setup

You have a protected remote (Brân) and two installable cards: an agenda (Offworld) and an economy asset (Regolith). Runner has no killer, so Brân costs them 3 clicks to get through.

**Key insight:** Clicking through Brân = Runner's entire turn.

## Q1: The Scoring Line

**Install Offworld, credit, credit:**

| Turn | Action | Credits | Board |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| T1-1 | Install Offworld in Server 1 | $3 | Offworld behind Brân |
| T1-2 | Credit | $4 | — |
| T1-3 | Credit | $5 | — |
| T2-1 | Seamless Launch ($1) | $4 | Offworld at 2 counters |
| T2-2 | Advance | $3 | Offworld at 3 counters |
| T2-3 | Advance | $2 | Offworld at 4 counters → **SCORE** |

**End state:** 2 points, $2 + $7 (Offworld bonus) = $9

**Note:** Seamless Launch says "card you did NOT install this turn" — that's why we credit T1 instead of advancing.

## Q2: The Regolith Line

**Install Regolith, credit, credit:**

| Turn | Action | Credits | Board |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| T1-1 | Install Regolith in Server 1 | $3 | Regolith behind Brân |
| T1-2 | Credit | $4 | — |
| T1-3 | Credit | $5 | — |

**The plan:** You're baiting the Runner into checking.

## Q3: The YOMI (Leveling Game)

### If Runner checks the remote:

Runner's turn:
- Click 1: Run Server 1
- Click 2: Break Brân sub 1 (click-through)
- Click 3: Break Brân sub 2 (click-through)
- Click 4: Break Brân sub 3 (click-through)
- Access: See Regolith. Trash it ($3).

**Runner spent:** Entire turn + $3
**Runner gained:** Denied you ~$6 of Regolith value

### Your Turn 2 (after they checked):

| Action | Credits | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Install Offworld | $5 | In the now-empty Server 1 |
| Install ICE on Server 1 | $5 | Add depth to remote |
| Credit | $6 | Build up |

**Now the remote has Brân + new ICE.** Runner checking costs even MORE next time.

### If Runner DOESN'T check:

- T2: Rez Regolith ($2), click it ($3), click it ($3) → $9
- T3: Install Offworld, advance, advance
- T4: Advance, Seamless → Score with massive economy

You got free Regolith value AND still score.

## Why Q2 Can Be Better Than Q1

**Q1 (Install Offworld immediately):**
- ✓ Scores Turn 2
- ✗ Runner knows you have an agenda in the remote
- ✗ If they find a Killer, you might lose the agenda

**Q2 (Install Regolith first):**
- ✓ Conditions Runner: "Clicking through Brân might be a waste"
- ✓ If they check: You traded Regolith for their entire turn + $3
- ✓ If they don't check: Free economy
- ✓ Next remote install has ICE + uncertainty

**The leveling game:**

| Level | Corp thinks | Runner thinks |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 0 | "I have agenda, install it" | "They installed, I check" |
| 1 | "Install Regolith, waste their turn" | "I checked, it was econ, I look dumb" |
| 2 | "They stopped checking, install agenda" | "I won't check anymore" |
| 3 | "They might check again..." | "Maybe I should check..." |

**The fundamental lesson:** The THREAT of an agenda is a resource. You don't have to score immediately — sometimes conditioning your opponent first creates better scoring windows later.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| Install Offworld, advance, advance | Can't Seamless same turn you installed |
| Always install agenda immediately | Predictable, Runner always checks |
| Never install agenda | Runner stops checking, you never score |
| Thinking Regolith is "slow" | Trading their turn + $3 for your asset is value |
