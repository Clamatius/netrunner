# Answer: remote-002-corp

## The Setup

Both players at 0 points - early game, first score matters. Runner is missing Carmen (their Killer) and has limited economy on board. You have Offworld Office and need to decide where to install it.

**The simple read:** No Killer = Sentry ICE creates problems.

**The real question:** How much of a problem? Is it a lock, or just a tax?

---

## Run Table: Server 2 (Palisade)

| ICE | Type | Strength | Subs | Breaking Cost |
|-----|------|----------|------|---------------|
| Palisade | Barrier | 4 (remote) | 1 ETR | Cleaver: 2 boost + 1 break = **3 credits** |

**Runner can break.** Cleaver handles Barriers. Server 2 is not safe - just a $3 tax.

---

## Run Table: Server 1 (Karunā)

| ICE | Type | Strength | Subs | Breaking Cost |
|-----|------|----------|------|---------------|
| Karunā | Sentry | 3 | 2 net, 2 net | Carmen: 4 credits. **Runner has no Carmen!** |

**Runner cannot break with credits.** But they CAN tank the damage and access anyway - Karunā has no ETR.

---

## Q1: Install in Server 2

**Corp Turn 4:**
| Step | Action | Credits |
|------|--------|---------|
| Start | — | 7 |
| Click 1 | Install Offworld in S2 | 7 |
| Click 2 | Advance | 6 |
| Click 3 | Advance | 5 |

**Runner Turn 4:**

Many lines work. The simplest:

| Step | Action | Credits | Notes |
|------|--------|---------|-------|
| Start | — | 4 | |
| Click 1 | Run Server 2 | 4 | |
| — | Break Palisade | 1 | 3 credits |
| — | Access Offworld | 1 | **STEAL** |

**Result:** Runner steals easily. Server 2 is not defensible.

---

## Q2: Install in Server 1

**Corp Turn 4:**
| Step | Action | Credits |
|------|--------|---------|
| Start | — | 7 |
| Click 1 | Install Offworld in S1 | 7 |
| Click 2 | Advance | 6 |
| Click 3 | Advance | 5 |

**Runner Turn 4 - The Decision Tree:**

Runner has no Killer installed. Their options:

### Option A: Run with 3 cards

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Run Server 1 | | |
| Corp rezzes Karunā | Corp: 5 - 4 = 1 credit | |
| Sub 1 fires | 2 net damage | Runner: 3 → 1 card |
| Decision point | Jack out? | |

**If jack out:** 1 card in grip, run failed. You score next turn.

**If continue:** Sub 2 fires, 2 more damage. 2 > 1 = **FLATLINE**.

With 3 cards, Runner cannot tank. The math doesn't allow it.

### Option B: Draw first, then run

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Click 1 | Draw | 4 cards in grip |
| Click 2 | Draw | 5 cards in grip |
| Click 3 | Run Server 1 | |
| Tank Karunā | 4 damage | 5 - 4 = 1 card |
| Access | | Steal Offworld |

This line works mathematically. But:

1. Uses 2 clicks to draw up
2. Runner ends at 1 card, crippled
3. They have no Verbal Plasticity (slow recovery)
4. No economy engine running (no Smartware drip)
5. Even "winning" leaves them behind on board

### Option C: They have an answer in grip

**Worst cases:**

| Card | Effect | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Mayfly | AI breaker, breaks anything | They break Karunā, access, steal |
| Tread Lightly | ICE costs +3 to rez | Karunā costs 7, you have 5 → can't rez → they steal for free |
| Carmen | Install, break | They were sandbagging the Killer |

If any of these are in their grip, Server 1 isn't safe either.

## Q3: The Nico Trap

"I'll build economy first, score later." This feels safe. It's not.

**The Nico Line (Install, Advance, Rez):**

| Step | Action | Credits |
|------|--------|---------|
| Start | — | $7 |
| Install Nico in S2 | — | $7 |
| Advance (bluff) | — | $6 |
| Rez Nico | — | $4 |

Or just Install + Rez = $5 remaining.

**The Problems:**

| Issue | Why It Hurts |
|-------|--------------|
| Only $1 drip | Nico is slow economy (not Adonis) |
| Can't score this cycle | Offworld still in hand |
| Runner gets time | They WILL find Mayfly/Carmen/Tread Lightly |
| Nico is fragile | Trash cost only $2 - Runner pays $5 total ($3 break + $2 trash) |

**The Math That Matters:**

Nico gives $1/turn drip. Runner can trash it next turn for $5.
- You paid $2 to rez
- Runner pays $5 to trash
- Net: You wasted a turn, Runner is down $5
- Meanwhile, you didn't score and they drew 4 more cards

Beginners will trash the Nico (wrong - it's just $1 drip). Then you jam the agenda behind Karunā and score. But competent Runners ignore it and find answers.

**When Nico IS Correct:**

- You don't have an agenda
- You have no scoring window anyway
- You need the economy to build a real remote later

Here, you HAVE the window. Don't give it away.

## Q4: The Best Line

**Install Offworld in Server 1, Advance, Credit.**

| Step | Action | Credits |
|------|--------|---------|
| Start | — | $7 |
| Install Offworld in S1 | — | $7 |
| Advance | — | $6 |
| Credit | — | $7 |

**Why Install-Advance-Credit beats Install-Advance-Advance:**

| Line | End Credits | If They Run |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Install-Advance-Advance | $5 | Rez Karunā → $1 |
| Install-Advance-Credit | $7 | Rez Karunā → $3 |

Both lines score next turn (3 more advances). But Install-Advance-Credit leaves you with **$2 more** after rezzing. That's buffer for surprises, or economy for next turn.

**The Scoring Line:**

| Turn | Action | Credits | Agenda |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Turn 4 | Install, Advance, Credit | $7 | 1 advancement |
| — | Runner bounces off Karunā | $3 | — |
| Turn 5 | Advance, Advance, Advance | $0 | **Score!** (+$7) |

You end at $7 with 2 points. Runner is at 1 card, no steal, behind on board.

**Why This Is The Window:**

- No Killer on board
- No economy engine running
- 3 cards in grip (can't tank Karunā)
- Low credits (can't afford Tread Lightly + break)

If you don't score now, they'll find answers. The window is NOW.

## The Full Decision Tree

| Option | Ending Position | Verdict |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Offworld in S2 (Palisade) | They steal for $3 | ❌ Terrible |
| Nico in S2 | $4-5, no agenda installed, gave them time | ❌ Trap |
| Offworld in S1, Advance, Advance | $5 ($1 after rez) | ⚠️ Okay but tight |
| Offworld in S1, Advance, Credit | $7 ($3 after rez) | ✅ Best |

---

## Every Credit Matters

The difference between Install-Advance-Advance ($5) and Install-Advance-Credit ($7) is only $2. But after rezzing Karunā:

| Line | After Rez |
|------|-----------|
| I-A-A | $1 |
| I-A-C | $3 |

That $2 difference could be:
- A second ICE rez next turn
- The ability to play Hedge Fund after scoring
- Buffer against a Diversion of Funds
- The margin that wins or loses the game

Games regularly come down to $1. Track every credit.

---

## The Yomi Layer

Rezzing Karunā telegraphs "I want to hurt you before you access." A savvy Runner thinks: "If it was Urtica (trap), they'd want me to access freely. Therefore it's the agenda. Therefore I should tank."

But with 3 cards, they can't tank anyway. The grip size takes the yomi off the table.

With 4+ cards, this becomes a real read. With 3 cards, it's just math.

---

## The Pattern: Damage Threats vs. ETR

| ICE | Subs | Effect |
|-----|------|--------|
| Karunā | Damage only | Runner CAN access if they survive |
| Palisade | ETR | Runner CANNOT access without breaking |

Damage ICE doesn't lock the server - it taxes cards instead of credits. The "lock" only exists when grip size makes tanking lethal.

---

## What About Both ICE on One Server?

If Palisade → Karunā on Server 1:
- Runner must break Palisade ($3) AND face Karunā
- More taxing, but commits more to one remote
- Alternative: Naked agenda in S2 while they focus on S1?

Multiple layers is stronger but more resource-intensive.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|----------------|
| "Type lock, guaranteed score" | Runner can tank damage if they draw up |
| Installing in Server 2 | $3 tax isn't enough - they steal easily |
| Not reading the grip | Those 3 cards matter - Mayfly/Tread Lightly are blowouts |
| Ignoring rez costs | Tread Lightly makes Karunā cost 7, you have 5 |
| Assuming Runner will run | Jack out at 2 damage is the conservative default |

---

## Difficulty

**Medium.** This puzzle requires:

1. Reading Runner's rig for gaps (no Killer)
2. Understanding damage vs. ETR (Karunā doesn't end the run)
3. Counting grip size against damage (3 cards = can't tank 4)
4. Evaluating the risk (what could be in those 3 cards?)
5. Reading board state for information (no drip = not sandbagging)

The key insight: **Server 1 is better because Karunā creates a problem they probably can't solve with 3 cards, but it's a read, not a lock.** Netrunner is about calculated risks, not certainties.
