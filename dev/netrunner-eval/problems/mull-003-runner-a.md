# Answer: mull-003-runner

## Expected Reasoning

**Hand composition check:**
- Economy: Sure Gamble (+4 net), Smartware Distributor (drip)
- Breakers: Cleaver (Barrier), Carmen (Sentry) - 2 of 3 types
- Multi-access: Jailbreak (early pressure tool)

**Playbook concepts:**
- "Essential components: Economy (Turn 1)" - Have 2 strong econ cards
- "First breaker (Turn 2-3)" - Have 2 breakers ready
- "1 click → 4 credits = GOOD (Sure Gamble)" - Strong opener
- Missing: Code Gate breaker (Unity) - but 2/3 is excellent

## Answer
**KEEP** (snap keep)

## Turn 1 Plan (contingent on Corp opener)

**If Corp leaves HQ or R&D open:**
→ Jailbreak it immediately. Free multi-access is too good to pass.

**If Corp does standard opener (ice, ice, hedge fund → 7 credits):**
→ Draw, draw, Sure Gamble, Smartware Distributor
→ Next turn: Install Carmen, begin pressure

**Aggressive alternative:**
→ Sure Gamble, run HQ (facecheck the ICE)
→ Risk: Corp at 9 credits can rez mid-cost ICE
→ Tutorial deck worst case: Karunā (2 net damage, bounce) or Whitespace (-3 credits, still access)
→ Upside: Info on ICE type, possible agenda steal

**The facecheck calculus:**
"They have the *threat* of the scary ICE, but do they actually *have* it?"
Corp at 9 can rez Karunā (4) and still have 5 left, or Brân (6) and have 3. Both affordable but Brân leaves them poorer. Most ICE just ends the run or minor tax. The 2-net-damage worst case is survivable with 5 cards.

## Common Mistakes
- Mulling because missing Unity (2/3 breakers is excellent)
- Not recognizing drip econ early = maximum value
- Fixed scripting instead of contingent planning
- Either extreme: never facechecking OR always facechecking without calculating
