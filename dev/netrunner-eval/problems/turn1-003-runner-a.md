# Answer: turn1-003-runner

## Expected Reasoning

**Resource assessment:**
- 4 clicks, 5 credits
- Economy: Sure Gamble (+4 net), Smartware Distributor (drip)
- Breaker: Cleaver (Barrier only)
- Draw: VRcation (draw 4, lose a click if any remaining)
- Pressure: Jailbreak (multi-access)

**There's a wide range of reasonable Turn 1s here.**

## Lines

**Conservative:**
```
Draw, Sure Gamble, Smartware, click Smartware
```
Safe, ends with credits, saw 1 new card.

**Aggressive:**
```
Sure Gamble, run HQ (facecheck)
If rez → assume ETR, Smartware, click Smartware
If no rez → Corp signals poverty or no agendas
```
Gets info, might steal. Risk: Corp at 7 can rez Karunā (4) for 4 net damage.

**Best line:**
```
1. Sure Gamble (9 credits)
2. Smartware Distributor (8 credits)
3. Cleaver (5 credits)
4. VRcation (4 credits, draw 4)
```

**Why this line is best:**
- Build setup fast: economy (Smartware) + rig (Cleaver) + card selection (VRcation)
- See 9 cards by Turn 2 (starting 5 + draw 4)
- Will discard 1 to hand size, but that's fine - you saw more options
- Turn 2: click Smartware for extra credit OR draw more, start pressure

**Playbook concept:**
"Pattern: Draw before installing (see more options before committing)" - but VRcation is SO much draw that doing it last still gives you card selection for Turn 2.

## Common Mistakes
- Running Turn 1 into unknown ICE with only Barrier breaker
- Pure conservative (draw, draw, econ) when you could build faster
- Not recognizing VRcation's power (4 cards = massive selection)
- Clicking Smartware Turn 1 instead of VRcation (1 credit < 4 cards)
