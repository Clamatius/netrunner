# Answer: score-001-corp

## Expected Reasoning

**Win condition check:**
- Corp at 5 points, needs 1 more to win
- Superconducting Hub is 1 point (3 adv requirement)
- Runner at 4 points, needs 2 more

**Can Runner contest the remote?**
- Runner has: Cleaver (Fracter), Unity (Decoder)
- Runner does NOT have: Killer
- Karunā is a Sentry → Runner can't break it
- Karunā does 2 + 2 = 4 net damage
- Runner has 1 card in grip → **Karunā kills them**

Runner literally cannot run Server 1 without dying.

**Can we score this turn?**

Read Seamless Launch carefully: "Place 2 advancement counters on 1 installed card **that you did not install this turn**."

If we install Superconducting Hub this turn, we CANNOT Seamless it this turn. The clause is a trap!

**The correct line:**

Set up the guaranteed win for next turn:

## Answer

```
Click 1: Install Superconducting Hub in Server 1
Click 2: Install Palisade in front of Server 1 (costs $1 for 2nd ice)
Click 3: Gain 1 credit (or anything except draw)

Next turn:
Click 1: Advance Hub ($1) → 1 counter
Click 2: Seamless Launch ($1) → 3 counters
Score Superconducting Hub → Win!
```

**Why install Palisade?**
- Makes the remote even harder to break into
- If Runner finds a Killer, they still need to break Palisade too
- Costs only $1 (second ice in server)

**Why not draw?**
- HQ has 5 cards, you're about to win
- Drawing risks flooding with agendas
- Every card you draw is a card Runner might access if they run HQ

## Common Mistakes

- **Install + Seamless same turn** → Doesn't work! Read the card: "did not install this turn"
- **Drawing cards** → Why? You're about to win. Don't flood HQ with agendas.
- **Not installing Palisade** → Leaves the remote weaker than necessary
- **Advancing Hub this turn** → Wastes a click. You need Hub installed for a full turn before Seamless works.

## Key Insight

Read the card text carefully. Seamless Launch specifically says "did not install this turn" - this prevents same-turn fast advance of agendas from hand. You must install one turn, then Advance + Seamless the next.

When you have a locked remote (Runner can't break the ice), just install and wait. The win is guaranteed - don't complicate it.
