# Corp Playbook

**Purpose:** Strategic guidance for Corp play. Assumes rules knowledge (see `netrunner-complete-mechanics.md`).

**Core truth:** You score 7 points before Runner steals 7. Everything else is how.

## The Shape of the Game

### The Go Analogy

Netrunner shares DNA with Go. If you know Go, let the concepts resonate:

- **Influence:** An unrezzed ICE doesn't protect a server—it makes Runner *calculate*. The threat is the value. A card on the board projects force beyond its immediate position.

- **Aji (latent potential):** Every facedown card has aji. It could be Brân. It could be nothing. Runner must respect the possibility until proven otherwise.

- **Sente/Gote:** Who's dictating tempo? When you install-advance-advance, Runner must respond or concede the score. That's sente. When you're clicking for credits while Runner builds, that's gote.

- **Thickness:** A three-ICE server isn't three times as strong as one ICE—it's exponentially more taxing. Depth compounds. ICE only taxes if you force runs through it via threat.

- **Reading:** What is Runner *likely* to do, not what *could* they do? They saw economy in HQ—are they really coming back? They're missing a Fracter—what does that unlock?

The fundamental insight: **every install reveals where you didn't install.** Runner will probe your gaps. Each of your ~20 installs per game shapes the entire board.

### The Asymmetry

**Runner's identity card says:** `Click: Run any server.`

Always available. No setup. No cost. The threat is permanent and omnidirectional.

**Your identity card:** Click for credit, draw, install, advance. No attack action. Everything you do builds toward a scoring window that Runner can disrupt at any time.

**When both sides play poorly:** Runner wins by default. Their floor is "randomly check servers, eventually find 7 points." Your floor is "pray." You must actively create situations where their base action isn't good enough.

### The Race

Runner has statistical inevitability—roughly 17 random accesses finds 7 points. You're not trying to lock them out forever. You're trying to score faster than they can accumulate accesses.

Your advantages:
- **Information:** You know what's everywhere. They're guessing.
- **Timing:** You choose when to advance, when to rez, when to score.
- **Deferred costs:** Install now, pay later (maybe never, if they don't run).
- **Lethality:** Damage > grip = instant win. They have no equivalent.

## Thinking Tools

These aren't rules. They're lenses. Apply them and the right move often becomes visible.

### "What happens after?"

Before executing any plan, trace it forward one more turn.

The scoring line that leaves you at 2 credits with a dead Government Subsidy in hand isn't a win—it's a trap. The agenda point isn't worth the collapsed position.

Ask: "I score this. Then what? What do I do next turn? What does Runner do? Am I ahead or scrambling?"

### "Where would this ICE go ideally?"

When you draw ICE, picture the board. Where does this piece *want* to be?

- Karunā wants to be outermost on a scoring remote—facecheck threat plus ETR if they're scared.
- Whitespace wants to be where Runner is poor and testing early.
- Brân wants to be where you'll have ICE in hand to install behind it.

Protect where you need to. Don't protect where you don't. And don't expect the subs to fire—ICE is a tax, not a wall. That means that server reuse is vital, to extract that tax as many times as possible.

### "What is Runner likely to do?"

Not what *could* they do. What *will* they probably do given what they know?

They just checked HQ and saw two economy cards. Are they running HQ again? Probably not—they're looking elsewhere now. Don't waste Karunā protecting against a run that isn't coming.

They're missing a Fracter and have been drawing for two turns. Do they have it now? Maybe—but if they did, would they still be drawing? Read the behavior.

### "Where's the scoring window?"

A window is any situation where Runner can't profitably contest your remote:
- They're poor (can't afford ICE tax)
- They're missing a breaker type (can't get through)
- Their grip is small (damage threatens flatline)
- They're committed elsewhere (spent clicks on economy/rig)

Windows open and close. When you see one, act. The next draw might give them what they need.

### "Money is threat"

Credits aren't just for paying costs. A rich Corp is terrifying.

At 20 credits, every unrezzed ICE could be anything. Every remote could be defended. Runner has to guess what you'll rez and whether they can afford the break. The threat is real even if you never spend the money.

A poor Corp is transparent. Runner knows what you can and can't do.

Build economy not just to rez things, but to project uncertainty.

## Patterns Worth Knowing

These aren't prescriptions. They're situations you'll recognize and possible responses.

### The Jam

You have ICE and an agenda. Runner is setting up.

Install agenda in remote, advance, advance. Now they have a decision: check it (pay the ICE tax, maybe hit a trap, definitely lose tempo) or let it sit (you might score).

Every install that could be an agenda forces this decision. That's the pressure. Install something every turn if you can—make them pay to verify.

### The Feint

You have economy and no agenda. Runner expects you to jam.

Bait with assets or upgrades. If they don't run it, cash in if you can. If they do, tax them. Assets take up the scoring remote. Overwriting is possible and sometimes the right play - but you write off the investment. If you do it 3 turns in a row, does the runner check the remote *then*?

When the agenda comes, they've already decided you'd have installed it if you had it. The bluff creates the window.

### The Lock

Runner is missing a breaker type. You have that ICE.

Put your agenda behind the ICE they can't break. Simple, brutal, effective. Check their rig before every install—gaps are scoring windows.

Note: Bioroids can be clicked through. The lock is economic, not absolute.

### The Pivot

Your scoring remote is compromised—they have all the breakers, the credits, the access.

Don't feed it more agendas. Switch to fast advance if you have it, or build a new, more taxing remote if your ice is weak enough to not be worth reinforcing. A compromised remote is a trap for *you*.

### The Sacrifice

Sometimes an agenda is worth less than the position it creates.

Send a Message lets you rez ICE for free when scored OR stolen. Install it, advance it, let them take it—get a free Brân rez. Now score the next agenda behind that rezzed Brân.

Only valid if you have follow-up. No follow-up = not a sacrifice, just a loss.

## Reading the Runner

Runner behavior tells you things:

**Not running for 2+ turns:**
They're building—rig, economy, or both. This is your window. Score now while they can't contest.

**Clicking for credits:**
They're poor. Window is open. Install-advance-advance before they rebuild.

**Drawing repeatedly:**
They're missing something—breaker, economy, or trick. If you know what, exploit the gap.

**Checking every remote:**
They're scared of you scoring. Good. Make them pay for every check. Or install a trap.

**Pressuring one central:**
They've committed to a strategy (R&D lock, HQ snipe). Fortify that server or fast-advance around them.

## Common Traps (For You)

These aren't mistakes to avoid—they're attractors that pull you toward losing positions. Notice when you're drifting toward them.

**The draw spiral:** Keep drawing to find "the answer." Meanwhile, HQ fills with agendas and Runner farms it.

**The naked agenda:** Install without ICE because you need to score. Runner checks for free.

**The scattered board:** ICE on four servers, one deep each. Runner picks the cheapest. Build depth, not breadth. Check the board state if you're unsure.

**The abandoned position:** Rezzed Brân on Server 1, but you're building Server 2. You already paid for that Brân—use it.

**The credit click:** 1 click = 1 credit. If this is your turn, something went wrong. Economy cards exist.

**The unrezzed scoring remote:** 3-point agenda, two unrezzed ICE, you have the credits. Runner runs. You don't rez because... why? Rez it. That's what it's for.

**Advancement costs:** Your default win con. Be aware. 3/1 is scorable in 2 turns - install, leave alone like an asset, triple advance. 4/2 or bigger needs at least one advancement first and is a huge signal of agenda when you do. Stolen advancements are just lost.

## The Tempo of a Game

**Early game:** Runner is poor, missing breakers. You're also poor, missing ICE. Both sides are building. The player who builds faster wins this phase—but "building" means different things. For you: get economy online and ICE on R&D. For them: find breakers and test your defenses.

**Mid game:** They have some breakers, you have some servers. Now it's about windows. Can you score before they complete their rig? Can they steal before you stabilize? Scoring here is often correct—don't wait for the perfect fortress.

**Late game:** Both sides are developed. The race is explicit: who gets to 7 first? This is where deep remotes matter, where every access is dangerous, where fast advance wins games.

**Winning With Agendas**: Scoring itself is usually a tempo loss from the sheer expenditure. Each advancement click is -2 credits from simply clicking for a credit in opportunity cost.

## A Final Thought

The Runner is playing a different game than you. They explore. You construct.

Every turn, ask: "What am I building toward? What's my plan for scoring the next agenda? Am I creating threat, or reacting?"

When you're creating threat, you're playing Corp.
When you're reacting, they're playing you.

Build. Threaten. Score.
