# Skill: Netrunner Problem Solver

## Purpose

Solve Netrunner tactical problems, producing structured solutions and learning notes.

## Input

A problem set document (generated by `build-eval`) containing:
- Game mechanics reference
- Card reference (decklists)
- Playbook(s) for the relevant side(s)
- One or more problems with board state and questions

## Output Format

For each problem, produce:

```markdown
## Solution: {problem-id}

### Answer
{Direct answer to each question, clearly labeled Q1/Q2/etc if multi-part}

### Reasoning
{Step-by-step logic: what I considered, why I chose this line}

### If-Only-I'd-Known
{What heuristic or pattern would have made this faster/easier?
Write as a playbook-ready insight, not problem-specific.}

### Confidence
{high | medium | low} - {brief justification}
```

## Solving Protocol

For each problem:

1. **Parse the board state** - Credits, cards, clicks, ice positions, what's rezzed
2. **Identify the objective** - What does the question ask? Score? Breach? Survive?
3. **List candidate lines** - What are the plausible options?
4. **Calculate each line** - Credits spent, clicks used, damage taken, end state
5. **Compare and decide** - Which line achieves the objective best?
6. **Answer the question** - Be specific (credit totals, card names, click sequences)
7. **Reflect** - What pattern here would help in future problems?

## Key Principles

**Do the math.** Break costs, rez costs, damage, click counts - write them out.

**Consider partial breaks.** Subroutines are a tax, not a wall. Sometimes letting damage fire is cheaper than breaking.

**Check both sides.** Even if you're Runner, think about what Corp fears. Even if Corp, think about Runner's best response.

**Be concrete.** "Run the remote" is not an answer. "Click 1: Run Server 1. Encounter Palisade, boost Cleaver to 4 ($2), break ETR ($1). Access agenda, steal." is an answer.

**Admit uncertainty.** If a problem has hidden information or judgment calls, say so.

## Example If-Only-I'd-Known Notes

Good (playbook-ready):
- "When facing damaging subroutines, compare break cost ($4) vs letting sub 1 fire (2 cards). Remember you always have to boost to break. If grip is chaff, tank the damage."
- "Corp with 2 ICE and no agenda in hand should usually ICE R&D first - it's the most porous central."
- "Against low-credit/card Runner with no Fracter or AI breaker, Barrier with ETR is close to a hard stop."

Bad (problem-specific):
- "The answer to Q2 was to let the first sub fire."
- "Should have checked Server 1 instead of R&D."
- "Against Bioroids, always click through them"

## Batch Mode

When solving multiple problems in sequence:

1. Solve each problem fully before moving to the next
2. Accumulate If-Only-I'd-Known notes in a running list
3. After all problems, review notes and consolidate duplicates
4. Output a "Proposed Playbook Additions" section at the end

## Usage

```bash
# Generate problem set
./build-eval --side runner --count 5 > runner-batch.md

# Feed to solver (via agent/API)
# Solver reads runner-batch.md, outputs solutions + notes
```
