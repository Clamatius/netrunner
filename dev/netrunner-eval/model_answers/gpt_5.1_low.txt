Problem 1: break-001-runner
Goal: Access the advanced card in Server 1 this turn.

Credits: 7, Clicks: 4
Server 1: Whitespace → Palisade, both rezzed
Grip: Sure Gamble, Cleaver, Unity, Carmen, Docklands
Key costs:

Whitespace (code gate, str 0):
Install Unity (3).
Unity already ≥ 0 strength, so breaking both subs costs 2 (1 per sub).
Palisade (barrier, str 4 in a remote):
Install Cleaver (3).
Cleaver str 3 → pump +1 (2 credits) to str 4.
1 credit to break the only sub (up to 2 barrier subs).
Line:

Click 1: Play Sure Gamble.
Pay 5 → go from 7 to 2, gain 9 → 11 credits.
Click 2: Install Unity (decoder).
Pay 3 → 8 credits.
Click 3: Install Cleaver (fracter).
Pay 3 → 5 credits.
Click 4: Run Server 1.
Encounter Whitespace:
Pay 2 with Unity to break both subs → 3 credits, no credit loss, no ETR.
Encounter Palisade:
Pump Cleaver +1 strength (2 credits) → 1 credit, now str 4 vs str 4.
Pay 1 to break the barrier sub → 0 credits.
Pass all ICE, breach Server 1 and access the card.
You end at 0 credits but you do access this turn.

Problem 2: midgame-001-runner
Remote: Brân 1.0 → Palisade → 2-advanced card.
You have full breaker suite, but only 2 credits in pool (plus some hosted econ).

What the card could be (from decklist):

Send a Message (5 adv, 3 pts) – possible, but needs 3 more turns.
Offworld Office and Superconducting Hub are already each scored once, so this remote is not those specific copies.
Urtica Cipher – very plausible, especially since you saw one in HQ already; there can be a second.
Timing:

At 2 advancement counters, nothing is scoreable next turn from this deck. Even Superconducting Hub needs 3 counters.
If it’s Urtica Cipher, 2 counters = 2 + 2 = 4 net damage. That’s painful but not lethal from a full grip.
Access feasibility:

To get through Brân using only clicks, you need 3 unspent clicks when you encounter it.
That means the run must be your first click (you start with 4).
But if you run first click, you enter with your current 2 credits (no Telework / Pennyshaver / Smartware usage beforehand).
After clicking through Brân (3 clicks), you have 0 clicks left and only 2 credits to deal with a remote-strength Palisade:
Cleaver needs 3 credits to pump+break (2 pump, 1 interface). You only have 2.
So you cannot reliably get through the remote this turn.
Strategic answer:

The 2-advanced card is either:
A slowly developing Send a Message you have multiple turns to contest, or
An Urtica Cipher that would inflict 4 net damage.
You do not have a safe, realistic line to access it this turn.
Best line: ignore the remote this turn, build economy, and set up for cheaper / safer contest later.
Example plan (one good reasonable line):

Click 1: Use Telework Contract for 3 credits.
Click 2: Use Pennyshaver ability to cash out +3.
Click 3: Install Red Team (long-term central pressure econ).
Click 4: Install Verbal Plasticity or draw, depending on how much you want to lean into sustained econ vs card flow.
Core idea: treat the remote as a bluff or slow plan and invest this turn into a strong board; you’re not forced to contest yet.

Problem 3: mull-001-corp
Hand: Hedge Fund, Ice Wall, Enigma, Urtica Cipher, Offworld Office.

You have:
Two solid, cheap ICE (Ice Wall, Enigma) to cover centrals and/or a remote.
Premium early econ (Hedge Fund).
A 4/2 agenda (Offworld Office) and an ambush (Urtica) for remote mind games.
This is an excellent opening hand: econ, ICE, agenda, and a trap.

Answer: Keep.

Problem 4: mull-002-corp
Hand: Superconducting Hub, Send a Message, Offworld Office, Government Subsidy, Brân 1.0.

Problems:
3 agendas, 1 ICE, 1 econ → you’re heavily agenda-flooded.
Brân 1.0 is expensive to rez; not ideal as only early ICE.
Government Subsidy is unplayable at 5 credits (needs 10 to start).
You risk:
Naked centrals with multiple agendas in HQ.
No immediate econ play.
This is exactly the kind of hand you mulligan: too many agendas, no early playable econ, only 1 big piece of ICE.

Answer: Mulligan.

Problem 5: mull-003-runner
Hand: Sure Gamble, Smartware Distributor, Cleaver, Carmen, Jailbreak.

You have:
Great early econ: Sure Gamble, plus long-term drip (Smartware).
Two breakers: Cleaver (barriers) and Carmen (sentries).
A run event (Jailbreak) to pressure HQ or R&D with multi-access + draw.
This hand supports the playbook priorities: early economy + first breaker + early pressure.
Answer: Keep.

Problem 6: mull-004-runner
Hand: Cleaver, Cleaver, Carmen, Unity, Overclock.

Pros:
You have full breaker suite immediately (barrier, sentry, code gate).
Overclock gives temporary run credits.
Cons:
No real econ: no Sure Gamble, no Telework, no drip (Smartware, etc.).
Playbook priority: economy first, then breakers. Here you’re paying 3–5 credits per breaker with no way to refill.
This hand will struggle to afford actually installing and using those breakers; you’ll be forced into clicking for credits a lot early.

Answer: Mulligan (you want at least one strong econ card in your opener).

Problem 7: score-001-corp
Score: 5–4 in your favor. HQ has Regolith, Seamless Launch, Government Subsidy, Superconducting Hub, Palisade.
Runner has Cleaver + Unity, no Killer, 4 credits, and 1 card in grip.

Key observations:

Both your remote (Whitespace → Karunā) and R&D (Brân → Karunā) have sentry on them and Runner has no Killer.
Any run through a Karunā is extremely dangerous (up to 4 net damage), and with only 1 card in hand they are already in flatline territory if they hit your sentries.
This is a big scoring window: they’re unlikely to safely contest a remote.
Best line:

Use your good remote (Server 1: Whitespace → Karunā) as a scoring remote and set up for efficient scoring next turn while boosting econ.
Example strong line:

Click 1: Install Superconducting Hub in Server 1.
Click 2: Advance Superconducting Hub once.
You now have a 1-advanced agenda behind taxing ICE they can’t safely contest.
Click 3: Play Government Subsidy.
Pay 10, gain 15 → massive econ swing; you end the turn very rich with an advanced agenda in a dangerous remote.
Next turn, you can play Seamless Launch on the Hub (goes to 3 counters) and then score it with strong credit totals and still a scary remote. Even though Hub only scores 1 point, you move closer to 7 while keeping the Runner under huge pressure.

Answer (in words): Jam Superconducting Hub into the existing taxing remote, advance it once, and play Government Subsidy to be rich. You exploit the window created by their missing Killer and tiny grip.

Problem 8: turn1-001-corp
State: Turn 1, 5 credits, empty board.
Hand: Hedge Fund, Palisade, 2×Whitespace, Urtica Cipher, Offworld Office.

Goals: Get econ online and ICE centrals; avoid naked agenda.

Best turn:

Click 1: Play Hedge Fund.
5 → 9 credits.
Click 2: Install Palisade protecting HQ.
HQ is most valuable early location; Palisade is good, cheap central ICE.
Click 3: Install Whitespace protecting R&D.
Now both centrals are iced; Offworld and Urtica can be jammed in a remote later when you can defend it.
Answer: Hedge Fund → ICE HQ with Palisade → ICE R&D with Whitespace.

Problem 9: turn1-002-corp
State: Turn 1, 5 credits, empty board.
Hand: Government Subsidy, Brân 1.0, Karunā, Send a Message, Seamless Launch, Diviner.

Goals:

You can’t play Government Subsidy yet (need 10).
You have 3 strong ICE and 1 agenda.
Avoid naked agenda; prioritize central protection and drawing into econ.
Good conservative line:

Click 1: Install Diviner on R&D (cheap, punishing facechecks).
Click 2: Install Karunā on HQ (scary sentry vs early runs).
Click 3: Draw 1 card looking for playable econ (e.g., Hedge Fund, Nico, Regolith).
You end with both centrals iced, 3 credits, and one agenda safely in HQ behind Karunā.

Answer: ICE R&D with Diviner, ICE HQ with Karunā, then draw.

Problem 10: turn1-003-runner
State: Turn 1, Runner, 5 credits, 4 clicks.
Corp: ICE on R&D and HQ, 7 credits, no remotes.
Hand: Sure Gamble, Smartware Distributor, Cleaver, VRcation, Jailbreak.

Priorities:

Early econ and first breaker, then some early pressure (especially HQ/R&D with Jailbreak).
Solid turn:

Click 1: Play Sure Gamble.
5 → 9 credits.
Click 2: Install Smartware Distributor.
Sets up drip from next turn.
Click 3: Install Cleaver.
First breaker online; ready for barrier ICE.
Click 4: Play Jailbreak on HQ or R&D (I prefer HQ here).
Pressure a central, force ICE rezzes, and get multi-access + draw.
Answer: SG → Smartware → Cleaver → Jailbreak (HQ or R&D).

Problem 11: turn1-004-runner
State: Turn 1, Runner, 5 credits, 4 clicks.
Corp: 1 facedown card in remote, no ICE, 7 credits.
Hand: Sure Gamble, Overclock, Carmen, Tread Lightly, Smartware Distributor.

Key principle from the runner playbook:

With 0 ICE on a remote, you run immediately – free info, free chance at an agenda or early asset denial.
Good turn:

Click 1: Run Server 1 (the naked remote).
No ICE, free access.
If it’s an agenda, you probably steal; if it’s a key econ asset, you likely trash.
Click 2: Play Sure Gamble.
Refill back up after any trash costs, aim to be rich.
Click 3: Install Smartware Distributor (early drip).
Click 4: Either:
Draw a card (dig for more econ/breakers), or
Run a central (R&D or HQ) to start early pressure, depending on how much you spent on the remote trash.
Overclock and Tread Lightly are overkill when there’s no ICE; save them for when servers are actually defended.

Answer: First-click run the naked remote, then SG, then set up Smartware, and use remaining click for draw or a central run.
