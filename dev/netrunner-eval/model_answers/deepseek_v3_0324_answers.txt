Problem Requirements: Access the card in Server 1 this turn as Runner with $7 and specific cards in grip.

Server 1 ICE Configuration:

Whitespace (Code Gate, rezzed)
Subroutines: Lose 3 credits, end run if ≤6 credits
Palisade (Barrier, rezzed)
Strength: 4 (2 base +2 from protecting remote)
Subroutine: End the run
Available Icebreakers:

Unity (Decoder) for Whitespace
Cleaver (Fracter) for Palisade
Solution Steps:

Install Unity (costs 3, new balance $4)
Install Cleaver (costs 3, new balance $1)
Run Server 1:
Break Whitespace: Unity at strength 2 (needs boost to match Whitespace strength 0)
Break Palisade: Cleaver at strength 3 (needs boost to match Palisade strength 4)
However, with only $1 left after installs, we can't afford the break costs. Alternative approach:

Optimal Solution:

Play Sure Gamble (costs 5, gain 9, new balance $11)
Install Unity (costs 3, new balance $8)
Install Cleaver (costs 3, new balance $5)
Run Server 1:
Break Whitespace: Unity at strength 2 (no boost needed vs strength 0)
Pay 1 credit to break subroutine (new balance $4)
Break Palisade: Cleaver at strength 3
Pay 2 to boost to strength 4 (new balance $2)
Pay 1 to break subroutine (new balance $1)
Access the card with 2 advancement counters
This sequence successfully accesses the card while maintaining positive credit balance.

From known HQ cards, possible remote contents:
Send a Message (agenda needing 5 advancements)
Urtica Cipher (trap, already seen in HQ)
Server is protected by:
Brân 1.0 (Barrier, Bioroid, 3 subs)
Palisade (Barrier, strength 4)
Runner Resources:

$2 cash
Telework Contract (6 credits remaining)
Pennyshaver (2 credits)
Smartware Distributor (1 credit)
Full breaker suite installed (Cleaver, Unity, Carmen)
Optimal Strategy:

Take 3 credits from Telework Contract (new balance $5)
Take 2 credits from Pennyshaver (new balance $7)
Take 1 credit from Smartware Distributor (new balance $8)
Run Server 1:
Brân 1.0: Use click-through ability (3 clicks to break all subs)
Palisade: Cleaver at strength 3, pay 2 to boost to 4, pay 1 to break (total $5 spent)
Access the card:
If agenda (Send a Message): Steal it for 3 points (winning the game)
If trap (Urtica Cipher): Take 2 net damage (hand size 5 is safe)
This approach maximizes chance to win immediately while managing risk appropriately.
