Solutions (1–11)
1) break-001-runner — Access Server 1 this turn (with credit math)
Goal: Get through rezzed Whitespace then rezzed Palisade and breach.

Starting: Runner $7, grip contains Sure Gamble, Unity, Cleaver, etc. Rig empty.

Line (4 clicks):

Play Sure Gamble: pay 5, gain 9
Credits: 7 -> 11
Install Unity (cost 3)
Credits: 11 -> 8
Install Cleaver (cost 3)
Credits: 8 -> 5
Run Server 1 (start run with $5)
Break math during the run:

Whitespace (per problem text: 2 subs)
Use Unity to break both subs: 2 credits total (1+1)
Credits: 5 -> 3
Palisade (remote-strength 4; 1 “end the run” sub)
Pump Cleaver once to reach strength 4: 2 credits
Break sub with Cleaver: 1 credit
Credits: 3 -> 0
Result: You pass both ICE and breach Server 1 this turn.

2) midgame-001-runner — Remote w/ 2 advancements: what is it and what do you do?
Key read:

Last turn you saw HQ was: Urtica Cipher, Nico Campaign, Palisade, Whitespace (no agendas).
A 2-advanced, double-rezzed remote is strongly signaling:
An agenda they topdecked / installed after your HQ run (e.g. remaining Superconducting Hub / Offworld Office), or
A Urtica Cipher they installed from HQ and started advancing (even though you saw it there last turn, they could have installed it after).
Why you probably must check it now:

With Seamless Launch in the Corp deck, 2 counters can become scoreable quickly (either via normal advancing or Seamless next turn), and you’re tied 3–3.
Best practical line: contest immediately this turn
This hinges on one important assumption:

Assumption: At the start of your turn you effectively have access to $3 for the run (e.g. because the listed Smartware Distributor (1 hosted) represents a start-of-turn payout or equivalent).
If you truly start the action phase at $2 with no automatic +1, you’re 1 credit short of cleanly breaking Palisade and you can’t afford to spend a click first (you need 3 clicks remaining to click-break all Brân 1.0 subs safely).
Line (if you can start the run with $3):

Click 1: Run Server 1 (the remote).
On Brân 1.0: spend 3 clicks (bioroid ability) to break all 3 subs, especially the “install ICE inward” sub.
This avoids the nightmare outcome where the Corp installs a surprise ICE between Brân and Palisade mid-run.
On Palisade (remote strength 4): with Cleaver (strength 3)
Pump once (2 credits), then break ETR (1 credit) = 3 credits
1) break-001-runner (access Server 1 this turn)
Start: $7, rig empty.

Click 1: Play Sure Gamble (7 - 5 + 9 = $11)
Click 2: Install Unity ($11 - 3 = $8)
Click 3: Install Cleaver ($8 - 3 = $5)
Click 4: Run Server 1
On ICE:

Whitespace (2 subs): Unity breaks 2 subs = 2c → $5 -> $3
Palisade (strength 4 on remote, 1 ETR sub): Cleaver pump once (2c) + break (1c) = 3c → $3 -> $0
Result: breach Server 1 this turn.

2) midgame-001-runner (remote w/ 2 advancements: what is it, what do you do?)
Most likely:

Newly installed agenda (you previously saw no agendas in HQ), or
Installed Urtica Cipher from last-turn HQ and advanced twice.
Best play: contest now, because it’s already invested and could be scoreable soon.

Line (uses the fact Smartware Distributor pays at turn start; otherwise you’re 1 credit short):

Start of turn: take +1c from Smartware Distributor → effectively start at $3.
Click 1: Run the remote
On Brân 1.0: spend 3 clicks to break all 3 subs (prevents the “install ICE inward” blowout)
On Palisade: spend 3 credits total with Cleaver (pump once + break) to pass
Access the 2-advanced card (safe vs 2-advanced Urtica: 4 net damage vs your 5-card grip).
3) mull-001-corp
Keep. You have Hedge Fund + 2 early ICE (Ice Wall, Enigma) and a playable plan.

4) mull-002-corp
Mulligan. 3 agendas + Government Subsidy you can’t cast + only Brân for ICE = too clunky / agenda-flood risk.

5) mull-003-runner
Keep. Sure Gamble + Smartware Distributor + 2 breakers + Jailbreak = excellent opener.

6) mull-004-runner
Keep (slightly risky). You already have the full breaker suite + Overclock to fund an early run; missing long-term econ, but this is still strong.

7) score-001-corp (start of your turn, best line)
Runner has 1 card in grip and no Killer; your rezzed Karunā makes Server 1 effectively unrunnable.

Best line: set up a near-certain score next turn while staying safe.

Click 1: Install Superconducting Hub in Server 1
Click 2: Advance it
Click 3: Advance it (to 2 counters)
Next turn you can finish scoring (advance once, or use Seamless Launch depending on your follow-up/draw).

8) turn1-001-corp (T1 plan)
Click 1: Hedge Fund
Click 2: Install Whitespace on R&D
Click 3: Install Palisade on HQ
9) turn1-002-corp (T1 plan)
Goal: create a scoring remote that sets up Seamless Launch next turn.

Click 1: Install Diviner protecting a new remote
Click 2: Install Send a Message in that remote
Click 3: Advance it once
10) turn1-003-runner (T1 plan vs 2 iced centrals, no remotes)
Click 1: Install Smartware Distributor
Click 2: Play Sure Gamble
Click 3: Install Cleaver
Click 4: Play VRcation (as last click to avoid the “lose 1 click” downside) to dig for the rest of your rig.
11) turn1-004-runner (T1 plan vs naked remote)
You should check the remote immediately (no ICE, and 0-advanced Urtica is survivable).

Click 1: Run Server 1
If it’s trashable economy (Nico/Regolith), trash it
If it’s Urtica Cipher, take the damage, then trash if you choose
Click 2: Play Sure Gamble
Click 3: Install Carmen for 2 less (because you made a successful run)
Click 4: Install Smartware Distributor

All 11 problems have proposed best lines / decisions. If you want, tell me whether to treat Problem 2’s Smartware payout as already included in the $2 (it changes whether the remote run is immediately affordable).
