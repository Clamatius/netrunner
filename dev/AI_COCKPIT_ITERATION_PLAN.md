# AI Cockpit Development - Iteration Plan

## Vision
Build a comprehensive open-hand game test in `game_command_test.clj` that exercises all basic and intermediate Netrunner mechanics. This creates a "cockpit" demonstrating how to programmatically control every lever in the game.

**Key principle**: Each iteration adds ONE new mechanic, building on previous work.

**Target timeline**: 15-25 coding sessions to complete all phases.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Basic turn flow (credit, draw, end turn)
- [x] Playing economy operations (Hedge Fund)

- Verify credit/click changes and discard pile

**Cards needed**: Sure Gamble, Creative Commission

**Implementation notes**:
- Events: `(play-from-hand state :runner "Sure Gamble")`
- Events go to discard after playing
- Some events have additional costs (Creative Commission loses click)
- Must have clicks available to play events
- Events can be chained: play event → install card → play another event
- Click efficiency: Sure Gamble (4 credits/click) > Creative Commission (2 credits/click) > click for credit (1 credit/click)

---

## Phase 4: Basic Runs ⚠️ COMPLEXITY INCREASE

### Iteration 4.1: Unopposed Central Server Runs
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**New mechanics**: Running, accessing cards, "continue" timing
**Test function**: `test-unopposed-runs`

**Specific actions**:
- Run on HQ (no ICE) - access random cards from HQ
- Respond to access prompts (steal agenda / don't steal)
- Run on R&D - access from top of deck
- Run on Archives - access all cards in Archives

**Cards needed**: Just need Corp to have cards in HQ/R&D/Archives

**Implementation notes**:
- Use test helper: `(run-empty-server state :hq)` handles timing
- Or manual: `(run-on state :hq)` + respond to prompts
- Access prompts will appear for each card
- Stealing agenda: `(click-prompt state :runner "Steal")`
- **CRITICAL**: Agendas MUST be stolen (only choice is "Steal")
- Non-agendas offer "No action" choice

**Implementation** (game_command_test.clj:1094-1229):
- Archives run: Stole Hostile Takeover (1 point)
- HQ run: Accessed operation, chose "No action"
- R&D run: Accessed Offworld Office agenda, MUST steal (2 points)
- Total: Runner ends with 3 agenda points
- Each run costs 1 click
- Used `run-empty-server` helper for clean unopposed runs
- Used `assert-no-prompts` after each run to verify clean state

**Key learnings**:
- Agendas have ONLY "Steal" choice when accessed
- Non-agendas (operations, ICE, etc.) have "No action" choice
- Must handle prompt response based on card type
- run-empty-server is perfect for unopposed runs (no ICE)

**Focus**: Understanding run phases WITHOUT ICE:
1. Run initiation
2. Approach server (no ICE to encounter)
3. Access cards
4. Run ends

---

### Iteration 4.2: Unopposed Remote Runs

- Steal agenda from remote
- Verify agenda points awarded to Runner

**Implementation notes**:
- Remote servers: `:remote1`, `:remote2`, etc.
- Accessing remote shows all cards in that remote
- Steal: `(click-prompt state :runner "Steal")`
- Check: `(:agenda-point (get-runner))`

---

### Iteration 4.3: Running Through Unrezzed ICE
**Status**: ⏸️ PENDING

**Specific actions**:
- Corp installs ICE on HQ (DON'T rez yet)
- Runner runs HQ
- Approach ICE phase
- Corp chooses not to rez (pass priority)
- Runner continues past unrezzed ICE
- Access HQ

**Implementation notes**:
- Install but don't rez: `(play-from-hand state :corp "Palisade" "HQ")`
- During run: Corp gets rez window
- Corp passes: `(core/process-action "continue" state :corp nil)`
- Runner continues: `(core/process-action "continue" state :runner nil)`

**Focus**: Approach-ice timing, corp rez windows, priority passing

---

## Phase 5: Encounters With ICE ⚠️ CRITICAL COMPLEXITY

### Iteration 5.1: Basic ICE Encounter (No Breaking)
**Status**: ⏸️ PENDING
**New mechanics**: ICE rezzing, subroutine firing, encounter phases
**Test function**: `test-ice-encounter-basic`

**Specific actions**:
- Corp installs + rezzes Palisade on HQ
- Runner runs HQ
- Encounter Palisade
- Runner does NOT break subs
- Subroutines fire ("End the run")
- Run ends unsuccessfully

**Key run phases**:
1. Run initiated: `(run-on state :hq)`
2. Corp priority at initiation → `(continue state :corp)`
3. Runner continues → `(continue state :runner)`
4. Approach ICE (Palisade)
5. Corp rezzes ICE → `(rez state :corp ice)`
6. Corp priority → `(continue state :corp)`
7. Encounter ICE
8. Runner passes (doesn't use breaker) → `(continue state :runner)`
9. Fire unbroken subroutines
10. Run ends

**Implementation notes**:
- Palisade has 1 subroutine: "End the run"
- When fired, run terminates immediately
- No access happens
- Check: `(get-run)` should be nil after run ends

---

### Iteration 5.2: Breaking Barrier ICE

---

## Progress Tracking

### Completed: 10 iterations (Phase 1-3 complete + Phase 4.1 complete!)
### Current: Phase 4.2 Unopposed Remote Runs ready to start
### Remaining: ~10-15 iterations

---

## Success Criteria

By end of this plan, we should have:

✅ **Comprehensive test suite** in `game_command_test.clj` with 20+ test functions
✅ **All basic mechanics exercised**: turns, economy, installing, rezzing, running, breaking
✅ **Clear examples** of how to call each action from AI code
✅ **Debugged and working** - all tests pass consistently
✅ **Documentation** in comments showing why each action is called

---

## Development Strategy

1. **One iteration at a time** - Each session focuses on ONE iteration from this plan
2. **Build incrementally** - Later iterations reuse helper functions from earlier ones
3. **Test immediately** - Run `(test-FUNCTION-NAME)` after writing each one
4. **Debug in REPL** - Use `(def my-state ...)` to pause and inspect game state
5. **Commit after each working iteration** - Keep git history clean with descriptive messages

---

## File Organization

All tests live in `dev/src/clj/game_command_test.clj`:
- Helper functions at top (open-hand-game, print-game-state, etc.)
- Group related tests together by phase
- Add section comments `;;; Phase X: Description` for clarity
- Update comment block at bottom with new test function names

---

## Common Patterns

### Test Function Template
```clojure
(defn test-MECHANIC-NAME
  "Brief description of what mechanic is being tested"
  []
  (println "\n========================================")
  (println "TEST: Mechanic Name")
  (println "========================================")

  (let [state (custom-open-hand-game
                ;; Carefully curated hands to demonstrate mechanic
                ["Corp Card 1" "Corp Card 2"]
                (drop 2 gateway-beginner-corp-deck)
                ["Runner Card 1" "Runner Card 2"]
                (drop 2 gateway-beginner-runner-deck))]

    (println "\n--- Setup ---")
    (print-game-state state)
    (print-board-state state)

    ;; Series of actions with explanatory prints
    (println "\n--- Action: Description ---")
    (some-action state)
    (print-game-state state)  ; Show result after action

    ;; More actions with clear steps...

    (println "\n✅ Test complete!")
    nil))  ; Return nil to avoid console spam
```

### Debugging Tips
```clojure
;; Pause execution and inspect
(def my-state (open-hand-game))
(print-game-state my-state)

;; Find cards
(find-card "Palisade" (:hand (get-corp)))
(get-ice my-state :hq 0)  ; Get first ICE on HQ

;; Check prompts
(get-in @my-state [:corp :prompt])
(get-in @my-state [:runner :prompt])

;; Inspect run state
(:run @my-state)
```

---

## Notes & Learnings

### Timing Windows
- Many actions create priority windows where both sides can act
- Use `(continue state side)` to pass priority
- Prompt responses are mandatory (must click-prompt or click-card)

### State Mutations
- The `state` atom is mutable - changes persist
- Actions modify state directly
- Always check state after actions to verify changes

### Card References
- Cards move between zones (hand → board → discard)
- Must re-get card reference after moves: `(get-card state card)`
- Use `find-card` for lookups by title

### Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to handle prompts causes hangs
- Not checking if action succeeded (verify state changes)
- Assuming card positions (always check with helpers)
- Not accounting for costs (clicks, credits)

---

## Iteration Velocity Estimates

- **Simple iterations** (2.1-2.3, 3.1-3.3, 4.1-4.2): ~30-60 minutes each
- **Medium complexity** (4.3, 5.1-5.3): ~60-90 minutes each
- **High complexity** (5.4-5.5, 6.2, 7.1): ~90-120 minutes each
- **Total estimated time**: 20-35 hours of focused development

This plan represents approximately 15-25 pair programming sessions to complete.
