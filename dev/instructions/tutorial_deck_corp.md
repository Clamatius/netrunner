Notable cards:

**Seamless Launch (The Closer)**
- **Function**: Adds 2 advancement tokens to a card in a remote server.
- **Restriction**: Cannot be used on a card installed *this turn*.
- **The Play (4/2 Agenda)**:
    1. Turn A: Install `Offworld Office` (face down). Do not advance. (Looks like an asset).
    2. Turn B: Play `Seamless Launch` (2 adv), Advance (1 adv), Score.
- **The Play (5/3 Agenda)**:
    1. Turn A: Install `Send a Message`. Advance once. (Looks like a 3/2 or trap).
    2. Turn B: Play `Seamless Launch` (Total 3), Advance (Total 4), Advance (Total 5). Score.

**Send a Message (The Trap)**
- **Effect**: When scored OR stolen, you may rez 1 ICE for free.
- **Synergy**: `Brân 1.0` costs 6¢ to rez.
- **The Play**: Install `Send a Message` behind an unrezzed `Brân 1.0`.
    - If they steal it: You rez `Brân` for free. The server is now a fortress.
    - If you score it: You rez `Brân` for free. The server is now a fortress.
- **Value**: You trade 3 points for a high-tax clicks-or-$ remote.

**Manegarm Skunkworks (The Tax)**
- **Effect**: Runner must pay 5¢ or take 2 clicks/damage to pass.
- **Usage**: Install in the root of your scoring remote.
- **Timing**: Rez when they approach the server (after passing ICE).
- **Combo**: `Brân 1.0` + `Skunkworks` = harder for runner to click through

**Urtica Cipher (The Snare)**
- **Function**: Advanceable trap. 2 net damage + 1 per advancement.
- **Don't expect kills**: You're mostly hoping to bait a run through ice so they pay $ as well as damage to slow them down
- **Usage**: Install, advance, advance. Mimics an agenda. If they run on low cards, flatline.

ICE Roles and "favourite" server, typical cost to break:
- **Tithe**: HQ, R&D. $2. Anti-facecheck. Always rez (1 cost). Small tax and they don't have to pay it. They usually pay.
- **Karunā**: R&D, Remote: $4. "Fork" ICE. Runner must choose: End run OR take damage.
- **Whitespace**: R&D, HQ: $2/$1. Early game gearcheck. Becomes porous if Runner is rich (>6¢).
- **Brân 1.0**: Remote, R&D (lategame): $8/{2|3 clicks} The Wall. Stops runs. Clickable, but costs 3 clicks. Place innermost. 2 in the same server is very expensive to run - at least one costs $. The runner will almost always go elsewhere.
- **Palisade**: Remote: $3/$1 based on ability. Put on remotes if at all possible because it's a bad tax ice but good ETR.
- **Diviner**: R&D, HQ: Small tax code gate. Runner can dodge the ability with smart play, otherwise costs ~$3.

** BOOSTER cards if using

2× Orbital Superiority: agenda 4/2, 4 meat to tagged runners / tag to untagged. Generally better to score than try for a kill if you don't have the combo.
2× Funhouse: ice $5: code gate 4str. tag on encounter, tag or $4. Expensive but will tag runners a lot.
2× Public Trail: event $4 to tag runner UNLESS runner pays $8. The other half of the Orbital combo. Net: you also need the runner to be poor AND low cards AND running to kill.
2× Predictive Planogram: event $0: gain $3 / draw $3, both if runner tagged. Nice cheap spike econ
1× Retribution: $1 event: trash program or hardware of tagged runner. Great if they've already discarded a Decoder or Fracter - blow up the other one and they can't break the ETRs.
1× AMAZE Amusements- $1 upgrade: give agenda-stealing runners from this run 2 tags. ideally play behind Bran so they can't clear tags.

Note the Corp now has the abilities:
- click x3: purge all virus counters
- $2, click: trash a resource of a _tagged_ runner

The Runner now has the ability:
- $2, click: remove 1 tag.

IMPORTANT: With the booster added, deck size is now 40 cards and games are played to 7 points.
