# Runner Tutorial Deck: The Catalyst

Tutorial games are played to 6 points.

2x Creative Commission ($ event, play last click if possible)
3x Jailbreak (multi-access for centrals)
2x Overclock (spike $ for running. Particularly good with Mayfly)
3x Sure Gamble (affordable $)
2x Tread Lightly (use on servers with unrezzed ice)
2x VRcation (draw event, play last click if possible)
1x Docklands Pass (HQ multiaccess, play only if about to run HQ)
1x Pennyshaver (note the click to get the $)
1x Red Team (strong for R&D lock)
2x Smartware Distributor (slow $, click to charge)
2x Telework Contract (faster $, once per turn only)
1x Verbal Plasticity (double draw)

2x Carmen (Killer - Sentry breaker. note -$2 install on successful run)
2x Cleaver (Fracter - Barrier breaker)
2x Unity (Decoder - Code Gate breaker)
2x Mayfly (AI - breaks all types but dies at end of run. 2MU, great with Overclock bc expensive)

Corp cards of note:

**Urtica Cipher:** The only advanceable trap in the format.
- 2 + [counters] net damage
- 2 counters = 4 damage. 3 counters = 5 damage.

**Bran Cipher:** The biggest ICE in the format.
- Bioroid with 2 ETRs and 1 annoying sub. 8 to full-break with Cleaver.

**Whitespace:** Annoying code gate. Can be beaten without decoder by having $10+

**Karuna:** Potentially deadly sentry. 
- 2 damage, then you can jack out if you want, then 2 more
- Sometimes 4 damage is worth winning the game to access, but if the card is advanced you may flatline on Cipher

ICE breaking budget: $2 light (e.g. Whitespace), $4 medium (e.g. Karuna), $8 for full-break of Bran (worst case)

## The Rig (Breaker Suite)

**Mayfly (The Skeleton Key)**
- **Role**: Early game aggression / Emergency entry.
- **Cost**: 1¢ install & 2MU, but trashed after run.
- **Synergy**: `Overclock` (+5¢ for run) pays for Mayfly install + break costs.
- **Target**: Use to steal early agendas behind single ICE, or to snipe a remote when you don't have or know the right breaker.

**Cleaver (Fracter)**
- **Target**: **Barrier** (`Palisade`, `Brân 1.0`).
- **Math**: Breaks `Palisade` for 1¢ (if on central) or 3¢ (remote).
- **Note**: Requires money. `Brân` costs 8¢ to break! Consider clicking through `Brân` (2/3 clicks) instead.

**Unity (Decoder)**
- **Target**: **Code Gate** (`Whitespace`, `Diviner`).
- **Math**: Efficient. Gains strength from other installed decoders (none in this deck) or generally.
- **Strength**: 1¢ per +<# icebreakers> STR. 1¢ to break.
- **Whitespace**: Breaks for ~1-2¢. Cheaper than the 3¢ tax!

**Carmen (Killer)**
- **Target**: **Sentry** (`Karunā`, `Tithe`).
- **Install**: expensive (5¢). Install only when necessary.
- **Ability**: `Install` from grip for 3¢ whenever you make a successful run. (Great for tempo).
- **Math**: 4¢ to break `Karunā` (2 to boost STR + 2 to break).

## The Economy Engine

**Sure Gamble**: The gold standard. Play when >5¢.
**Creative Commission**: 1¢ cost -> +4¢ net gain. Ideally play as last click.
**Telework Contract**: Drip econ. Install, then gain $ over turns. High value.
**Smartware Distributor**: Slow drip. Good if game goes long. Requires charging after install to work.

## Strategic Synergies

**The HQ Snipe**
- **Tools**: `Docklands Pass`.
- **Target**: HQ.
- **Play**: Install Pass. Run HQ. Access +1 card.
- **Timing**: When Corp has cards in hand but isn't scoring (flooded).

**Red Team**
- **Role**: Economy + Pressure.
- **Cost**: 5¢.
- **Effect**: Run any central server not already run this turn. If successful, **gain 3 credits**.
- **Usage**: Huge tempo swing if centrals weak; late game r&d lock. Use on open/cheap servers including Archives to fuel up. Doesn't use up credits if you bounce off and now know the ICE.


## BOOSTER cards if using

2× Wildcat Strike $2: [+$6 / draw 4, _corp_ chooses which]
2× Mutual Favor $0: fetch icebreaker from deck. installs if successful run, but still fetches without. Best saved till you know what you need or the last one
2× DZMZ Optimizer $2: +1MU [discount on program installs side-benefit]
2× Leech: $1: +virus for central run, -virus for -1 str on any ice. Helpful to pay for central pressure
2× Conduit: $4: +virus for R&D run. click: run R&D for <virus> extra accesses. Very expensive but great late-game wincon

Note the Corp now has the abilities:
- click x3: purge all virus counters
- $2, click: trash a resource of a _tagged_ runner

The Runner now has the ability:
- $2, click: remove 1 tag.

Tag punishment possible other than resource trashing:
- Orbital Superiority: 4/2 agenda. On score: tag (tagless) or 4 damage (tagged)
If they score it, you're tagged and you have less than 4 cards you lose on the spot
- Retribution: $1 operation. Trash 1 program/hardware if Runner is tagged
Can be distressing to lose a vital icebreaker, so if in doubt keep a spare if possible instead of discarding

Important upgrade:
-AMAZE Amusements: +2 tags if you stole an agenda from the server

IMPORTANT: With the booster added, deck size is now 40 cards and games are played to 7 points.
