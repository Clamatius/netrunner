# UX Feedback Session - 2026-01-30

## Summary
Played full game as Runner vs heuristic Corp. **Runner won 6-1.** Multiple friction points discovered.

---

## Friction Point: Phantom "break" command

**Context**: During encounter-ice phase, I needed to break Palisade with Cleaver.

**Problem**: The system output suggests:
```
→ Or break subs with: break "Palisade" <breaker>
```
But `break` is not a valid command. Running it returns `❌ Error: Unknown command: break`.

**Suggestion**: Either:
1. Implement the `break` command as suggested, OR
2. Change the hint to show the actual command: `use-ability "Cleaver" 2` (referencing the auto-pump-break ability)

**Impact**: High - confusing UX, wasted time figuring out real command

---

## Friction Point: `--full-break` flag not working

**Context**: Ran with `--full-break` expecting auto-break of ICE.

**Problem**: At 2¢ (before Pennyshaver payout), system said "Can't afford to break Palisade, letting subs fire". But then on subsequent runs with 8¢, `--full-break` still let subs fire without trying to break.

**Debug output showed**:
```
🔍 DEBUG   [2] Match strength and fully break Palisade | playable=null dynamic=auto-pump-and-break
```
The `playable=null` might be the issue - ability wasn't detected as playable even with sufficient credits.

**Suggestion**:
1. Fix `--full-break` to actually attempt breaking when credits are available
2. Consider using Pennyshaver/hosted credits in the affordability calculation

**Impact**: High - core functionality broken

---

## Friction Point: Hand output lacks card abilities

**Context**: Needed to know Cleaver's pump/break costs.

**Problem**: `hand` command shows:
```
2. Cleaver [Program: Fracter, Icebreaker] (3¢, 1MU, str 3)
```
No ability text. I had to remember costs from game knowledge.

**Suggestion**: Add brief ability summary to hand output, or note "use `card-text` for details"

**Impact**: Medium - slows decision-making

---

## Friction Point: Prompt shows wrong ICE strength

**Context**: Encountering Palisade protecting Server 1.

**Problem**: Prompt showed `Palisade (str 2, Barrier)` but Palisade protecting a remote should be str 5 (3 base + 2 from ability).

**Observation**: Cleaver's auto-break was 3¢ which suggests only 2 str differential (3→5 would need +2 pump at 2¢/str = 4¢ pump + break = more than 3¢). So maybe the +2 wasn't applying? Or the cost shown was actually for str 3 ICE?

**Suggestion**: Verify ICE strength calculation includes positional modifiers

**Impact**: Medium - incorrect info for tactical decisions

---

## Friction Point: "Play" output unclear on prompts

**Context**: Played Jailbreak event.

**Problem**: Output said `🃏 Played: Jailbreak` without indicating a prompt was pending. Had to run `prompt` separately to see the "Choose a server" choice.

**Suggestion**: When playing a card creates a prompt, show it immediately:
```
🃏 Played: Jailbreak
   Choose a server: 0. HQ  1. R&D
```

**Impact**: Low - extra command needed, but flow not broken

---

## Friction Point: Status says "End of Turn" + "Waiting to start corp turn"

**Context**: After using all clicks, checking status.

**Problem**: Status showed both:
```
Clicks: 0 (End of Turn)
💡 Use 'end-turn' to finish your turn
```
AND
```
Status: 🟢 Waiting to start corp turn (use 'start-turn' command)
```

These are contradictory - am I waiting for the turn to end, or is Corp supposed to start?

**Suggestion**: Cleaner turn state messaging. If auto-end happened, don't show "use end-turn". If it didn't, don't show "waiting to start corp turn".

**Impact**: Low - confusing but doesn't block progress

---

## Friction Point: Start heuristic Corp is clunky

**Context**: Starting the heuristic Corp opponent.

**Problem**: Required running:
```bash
./dev/ai-eval.sh corp 7890 "(do (load-file \"./dev/src/clj/ai_heuristic_corp.clj\") (ai-heuristic-corp/start-autonomous!))"
```

This is error-prone and not discoverable.

**Suggestion**: Add `start-heuristic` command to send_command:
```bash
./dev/send_command corp start-heuristic
```

**Impact**: Low - one-time setup, but UX polish

---

## What Worked Well

- `status` command with agenda tracking (`Missing: 17 (Drawn: ~1, HQ: 7, R&D: 23, Remotes: 0/0)`) was excellent for tactical decisions
- `abilities "Cleaver"` showed clear cost breakdown
- `board` output clean and readable
- Auto-continue through boring windows saves lots of tedium
- Pennyshaver automatic payout after ETR was nice
- Run completion output with card text is helpful

---

## Proposed Fixes (Priority Order)

1. **HIGH**: Fix `--full-break` flag or document its limitations
2. **HIGH**: Fix "break" command hint to show actual command
3. **MEDIUM**: Add ability info to hand output
4. **MEDIUM**: Verify ICE strength includes positional modifiers
5. **LOW**: Show prompt immediately after playing events
6. **LOW**: Clean up turn state messaging
7. **LOW**: Add `start-heuristic` convenience command
