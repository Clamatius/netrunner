Notable cards:

**Seamless Launch (The Closer)**
- **Function**: Adds 2 advancement tokens to a card in a remote server.
- **Restriction**: Cannot be used on a card installed *this turn*.
- **The Play (4/2 Agenda)**:
    1. Turn A: Install `Offworld Office` (face down). Do not advance. (Looks like an asset).
    2. Turn B: Play `Seamless Launch` (2 adv), Advance (1 adv), Score.
- **The Play (5/3 Agenda)**:
    1. Turn A: Install `Send a Message`. Advance once. (Looks like a 3/2 or trap).
    2. Turn B: Play `Seamless Launch` (Total 3), Advance (Total 4), Advance (Total 5). Score.

**Send a Message (The Trap)**
- **Effect**: When scored OR stolen, you may rez 1 ICE for free.
- **Synergy**: `Brân 1.0` costs 6¢ to rez.
- **The Play**: Install `Send a Message` behind an unrezzed `Brân 1.0`.
    - If they steal it: You rez `Brân` for free. The server is now a fortress.
    - If you score it: You rez `Brân` for free. The server is now a fortress.
- **Value**: You trade 3 points for a high-tax clicks-or-$ remote.

**Manegarm Skunkworks (The Tax)**
- **Effect**: Runner must pay 5¢ or take 2 clicks/damage to pass.
- **Usage**: Install in the root of your scoring remote.
- **Timing**: Rez when they approach the server (after passing ICE).
- **Combo**: `Brân 1.0` + `Skunkworks` = harder for runner to click through

**Urtica Cipher (The Snare)**
- **Function**: Advanceable trap. 2 net damage + 1 per advancement.
- **Don't expect kills**: You're mostly hoping to bait a run through ice so they pay $ as well as damage to slow them down
- **Usage**: Install, advance, advance. Mimics an agenda. If they run on low cards, flatline.

ICE Roles:
- **Tithe**: Anti-facecheck. Always rez (1 cost). Small tax. Good on HQ.
- **Karunā**: "Fork" ICE. Runner must choose: End run OR take damage.
- **Whitespace**: Early game gearcheck. Becomes porous if Runner is rich (>6¢).
- **Brân 1.0**: The Wall. Stops runs. Clickable, but costs 3 clicks. Place innermost. 2 in the same server is very expensive to run - at least one costs $.
- **Palisade**: Barrier for remotes. 
- **Diviner**: Small tax code gate.
