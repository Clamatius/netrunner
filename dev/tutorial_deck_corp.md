Notable cards:

**Seamless Launch is conditional.**
- You cannot play it on cards played the same turn.
- Use it to score 4/2s or 5/3s (for 2x) while not advancing the agenda when remote is defended, to bluff an asset

**Nico Campaign works only once per turn but Regolith Mining License multiple times.**
- Nico takes up your scoring remote for a long time
- However, makes good bait and does provide income while you wait to score
- Rez at opponent end of turn to minimize vulnerability
- RML provides a lot of $ if you can defend

**Skunkworks makes a good remote very strong.**
- Rez it at server approach

**Urtica will only kill very careless runners.**
- Use to bait runs on servers to get runner low on $ so you can score

ICE:

**Whitespace ETR is conditional.**
- "End the run if Runner has 6¢ or less"
- Rich runner survives by eating the credit loss
- Poor runner gets stopped

**Karuna, Diviner and Tithe are all vulnerable to simply tanking damage to deny the winning score.**

**Palisade costs the runner $3 to break on remotes and $1 on centrals**

**Bran costs $6 and can be clicked through.**
- It is still worth it on the remote or R&D if you are rich
- Consider installing it if you have Send A Message so you can rez on score/steal
- Typically wastes 2+ Runner clicks per run on server
