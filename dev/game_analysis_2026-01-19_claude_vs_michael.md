# Game Analysis: Claude (Runner) vs Michael (Corp)
**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Final Score:** Corp 6 - Runner 3
**Result:** Corp wins

## Key Moments

### Turn 1 - Strong Opening
- Jailbreaked open HQ, saw Brân 1.0 and Nico Campaign
- Installed Cleaver, played Creative Commission last click (no click lost)
- Good intel gathering but didn't trash Nico (hindsight: should have)

### Turn 4 - First Blood (Corp)
- Corp scored Offworld Office (4/2) from Remote 1
- I was too slow building rig while Corp built economy
- **Lesson:** Contest remotes earlier, even imperfectly

### Turn 9 - The Comeback
- Remote 1 had 3 ICE + card with 2 advancements
- All-in run: clicked through Brân 1.0 (bioroid bypass!), broke Whitespace and Palisade
- **STOLE OFFWORLD OFFICE!** Tied 2-2
- Cost: All my credits, but worth it

### Turn 12 - Critical HQ Pressure
- Corp at game point (5-2) after scoring Send a Message
- Hammered HQ with Docklands Pass
- **STOLE SUPERCONDUCTING HUB!** Score now 3-5
- Three HQ runs in one turn - aggressive and necessary

### Turn 15 - The End
- Corp scored second Superconducting Hub from heavily fortified Remote 1 (5 ICE!)
- I was too poor to contest - 0-1 credits all turn
- **Corp wins 6-3**

## What I Did Well

1. **Bioroid bypass on Brân 1.0** - Saved 8 credits by clicking through 2 ETR subs
2. **Docklands Pass HQ pressure** - 2 accesses per run found both stolen agendas
3. **Jailbreak opening** - Free intel + draw + multi-access
4. **Last-click economy cards** - Creative Commission/VRcation without losing clicks

## What I Should Have Done Better

1. **Economy management was weak**
   - Spent too many turns at 0-2 credits
   - Should have clicked for credits more instead of drawing
   - Let Corp build to 43 credits while I scraped by

2. **Should have trashed Nico Campaigns**
   - Saw them 3+ times, never trashed
   - Each Nico = 9 credits to Corp over 3 turns
   - Short-term credit loss would have paid off

3. **Mayfly sat in hand the entire game**
   - Never installed it despite having it from turn 2
   - Could have used it for surprise runs on protected servers
   - The playbook says "AI breakers are brutal surprise plays" - I didn't execute

4. **R&D pressure was inconsistent**
   - Only ran R&D a few times
   - Top of R&D was often ICE/operations, but I didn't keep pressure up
   - Corp deck got to 8 cards - thin enough that consistent R&D pressure might have found agendas

5. **Remote 1 became too fortified**
   - 5 ICE by end of game - impossible to contest
   - Should have run it earlier when it had 2-3 ICE, even with incomplete information

## Corp's Winning Strategy

Michael played excellent glacier Corp:
- Built economy early (Nico Campaign, Regolith Mining License, Hedge Funds)
- Stacked ICE on scoring remote (5 ICE on Remote 1!)
- Kept HQ relatively unprotected (just Tithe) as a honey pot
- Never over-advanced - installed and scored methodically
- Used fast-advance threat (had 2x Seamless Launch in hand) to keep me guessing

## Statistics

- Agendas stolen: 3 (Offworld Office 2pts, Offworld Office 2pts... wait that's 4pts)

Actually looking at the log:
- Turn 9: Stole Offworld Office (2 pts) - tied 2-2
- Turn 12: Stole Superconducting Hub (1 pt) - score 3-5

So I stole 3 points total across 2 agendas.

Corp scored:
- Turn 4: Offworld Office (2 pts)
- Turn 12: Send a Message (3 pts)
- Turn 15: Superconducting Hub (1 pt)
Total: 6 points across 3 agendas

## Playbook Adherence

**Things I followed well:**
- "Jailbreak HQ" opening ✓
- "Click through Bioroids to save credits" ✓
- "Install breakers when locked out" ✓
- "Docklands Pass for HQ multi-access" ✓

**Things I violated:**
- "Trash economy assets when affordable" ✗
- "Sandbag AI breakers for surprise" ✗ (had Mayfly, never used it)
- "Don't dip below 5 credits" ✗ (constantly at 0-2)
- "Run R&D to deny Corp drawing agendas" ✗ (inconsistent pressure)

## Final Thoughts

3 points is respectable against an experienced human player. The Turn 9 Offworld Office steal was the highlight - perfectly executed bioroid bypass under pressure.

The game was winnable. If I'd found one more 3-point agenda (Send a Message was in R&D), I would have won. But my economy collapsed mid-game and I couldn't pressure all three servers effectively.

**Key takeaway:** Economy > Everything. I can't contest servers I can't afford to run.
