Keep is fine, I think. A Sure Gamble would be nice but Mayfly + Smartware + Jailbreak are all good early cards.

Cards: Smartware, Leech, Mayfly, Jailbreak, Cleaver

Corp t1: ice hq; ice r&d; new remote

Runner t1: Smartware; Leech; run hq, diviner -> 1 net, discard Mayfly, etr; Draw Mutual Favor

Seems ok. Losing Mayfly sucks but losing Cleaver might suck more actually. We'll see. I charge Smartware instead of drawing and do that next turn though.

Corp t2: credit; credit; credit

Runner t2: Mutual Favor: Carmen; Draw Telework Contract; Run Server 1 Urtica Cipher -> 2 net, discard Telework, Cleaver & trash $2; Draw Overclock

Error in the planning: Karuna is not as lethal as our Runner thinks. It lets you jack out half way, so it only flatlines you if you are on 1 or 0 cards. I am also suspicious - if it is in fact Karuna, how did they know? Did they peek at opp's hidden info? Skipping ahead... yep! Big cheats?!?

Regardless: this was... a bad turn. Ok, so if you'd done it my way, click 1 you draw Mutual Favor. Honestly I'd just keep drawing for money. I don't need Carmen on the board this second, and I'd actually rather have a Decoder to break the known ICE - if Corp doesn't score soon, HQ will be a great target.

BUT: Let's say as a beginner, Karuna scares my soul. Ok, so you want the Killer. This is pretty normal for beginners. (I often played tournament decks that damaged _themselves_).

Then: I run Archives, to get a successful run. I don't want to run Server 1 because I am close to broke and can't afford trash costs, trap or no. Now I Mutual Favor for Carmen. Bc successful run, Carmen costs $3 and installs that click.

Ironically, our Runner had actually thought to themself. in their Turn 2 Priorities:

"4. **Avoid Remote 1** -- it's Urtica Cipher (trap). Do not run it."

Great call! ><

- Remote 1 is naked. If the card is unadvanced, trap damage should be manageable.

Manageable in the sense you don't flatline, sure. I am pretty sure we give Cipher's effects in the tutorial but the Runner forgot about it.

Their plan was to install Carmen after the successful run.

And then: the worst sin (worse than checking the Cipher)... THEY TRASH IT!

This is a very agent-y move. It eliminates the possibility you'll forget and run it again. It's terrible. You're so poor and now you know where it is, so you just don't go there again. I _have_ seen beginners pull this one.

Ok so after that trainwreck of a turn, we're at:

- **Credits:** 2
- **Hand:** Cleaver, Carmen, Overclock (3 cards)
- **Rig:** Leech (program), Smartware Distributor (resource, uncharged)
- **Discard:** Mayfly, Mutual Favor, Jailbreak, Telework Contract (4 cards in heap)
- **Corp:** 6 credits, Diviner rezzed on HQ, unrezzed ICE on R&D, Remote 1 now empty (Urtica trashed)

Post-turn analysis:

"- Still no decoder installed. Diviner on HQ remains unbreakable."

This is not true. If all cards in the grip are even in cost you lose one to go through. If, say, you had 3 in hand, you can burn them all to hit HQ 3 times without a breaker at all.

That isn't indicated here, at all, but can be powerful in lategame to use cards as $ instead of paying.

Corp t3: Ice Server 2; install; adv

Runner t3: Run Archives; credit; install Carmen; use Smartware

You desperately need $ and didn't draw. At least you charged the Smartware. Claude often plays this way: top priority is to get breakers onto the table. I don't play that way - I've won many games of NR without playing a breaker (although usually because my deck is sneaky somehow admittedly).

corp t4: adv server1, score Superconducting Hub, draw 2; ice server 2; install server 2

Runner t4: draw Sure Gamble; credit; credit; credit

Yeah, that's why you didn't want to play the Carmen. On my line, you just draw and play it when you want the $. Instead you're working minimum wage. Burger-flipping for credits. Sad really.

Sometimes burger flipping does work, though.

Corp t5: rez Regolith Mining License, use; draw, install server 3

This is 90%+ a mistake from corp - up till now it's been fine at least from this pov. You already have a remote and only 1 ice on centrals. You have $ in a remote, use it. I guess you're bluffing the other Urtica or something?

Ok, looking at the Corp side: yeah they realized after they did it they had blundered really hard. I think it was mentally "my remote(s) are safe" or sth.

"- Set up scoring remote for Offworld Office (4/2, gives $7 on score)" is part of the plan for the turn. Get Mining! Scoring can come when you pay for ICE to the moon in a minute. If you lose the Offworld out of HQ (and it's the only one), eh. Sucks but I'll wipe my tears away with all the mining money. While the License is there, it's stopping you scoring in the remote so you need to cash it ASAP.

Runner t5: run server 3, steal Offworld Office; Sure Gamble; Cleaver; draw DZMZ Optimizer

Free office is fine, although a goofy move from Corp. Might indicate HQ is chock-full of agendas, or that they failed the bluff after they landed the first one.

I would draw before Sure Gamble or installing Cleaver. DZMZ Optimizer is decent in decks that install a ton, but these don't - you have to install 3 programs with it before it breaks even at $2 install. The MU is nice if you want Conduit later, but you don't need it now.

Corp t6: use License; draw Orbital Superiority; Whitespace Server 4

KEEP CLICKING THE LICENSE SO YOU CAN SCORE THE AGENDA YOU WOULD DRAW ANYWAY. ><

**Hand:** Overclock, DZMZ Optimizer (2 cards)

**Board:** HQ: Diviner rezzed (code gate, str 3). R&D: 1 unrezzed ICE (Karuna sentry, confirmed). Server 2: 1 unrezzed ICE (Palisade) + Regolith Mining License (rezzed, 6 credits). Server 4: 1 unrezzed ICE (freshly installed, unknown). Corp: 10 credits, 6 cards in hand.

**Score:** Runner 2 (Offworld Office) - Corp 1 (Superconducting Hub).

Runner t6: Overclock R&D, Karuna rez, Carmen break with Overclock, access Send a Message (!!), rez... whitespace; draw Creative Commission; Creative Commission

A skillful 3-point snipe off the top, for the low low price of a Whitespace (when you steal it you're praying Bran isn't somewhere).

In the Corp's place, I don't rez the Karuna. I want them to pay non-free credits and leech counters, if they remember they have it. The only thing rezzing it does is give them less $ for trashing this run. Given that the Runner shouldn't know what it is...
