# Game 1: Corp (Opus 4.5) vs Runner (Opus 4.6)

## Mulligan Decision

**Starting hand:**
- Karunā (ICE, sentry, 4 cost to rez)
- Offworld Office (4/2 agenda)
- Superconducting Hub (3/1 agenda)
- Urtica Cipher (trap)
- Manegarm Skunkworks (upgrade)

**Assessment:** Two agendas, no economy cards. This is risky - I have defensive tools (ICE, trap, Skunkworks) but no Hedge Fund, no Nico Campaign, no Regolith. Starting with 5 credits, if I install ICE and try to defend, I'll run out of money fast.

**Decision:** KEEP

**Reasoning:** While lacking economy, this hand has:
1. Good ICE (Karunā) for R&D/remote protection - 4 net damage deters early facechecks
2. Trap (Urtica) to bluff as agenda behind Karunā
3. Skunkworks for additional remote tax
4. Two agendas I can potentially score if Runner is slow

The risk: If I don't draw economy soon, I'll be poor and vulnerable. But mulliganing into a worse hand (all economy, no ICE) could be worse. The trap gives me bluff potential.

## Turn Log

### Turn 1 - Corp (5 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Diviner (code gate ICE, 2 rez cost)

**Hand after draw:** Karunā, Offworld Office, Superconducting Hub, Urtica Cipher, Manegarm Skunkworks, Diviner

**Assessment:**
- No economy, need to be careful with credits
- Two agendas in hand is risky - HQ runs could steal
- Priority: protect centrals, set up deception

**Plan:**
| Install Karunā on R&D (0 cost) → 5 credits
|| Install Diviner on HQ (0 cost) → 5 credits
||| Install Urtica Cipher in remote (0 cost) → 5 credits

**Reasoning:**
1. Karunā on R&D deters early facechecks - 4 net damage is scary without Carmen
2. Diviner on HQ provides light tax and info (odd-cost card = ETR)
3. Urtica in naked remote looks like economy asset - Runner might ignore it or run and eat 2 damage

**Result:** All installs successful. Ended with 5 credits, hand: Offworld Office, Superconducting Hub, Manegarm Skunkworks.

**Next turn goals:**
- Draw for economy (Hedge Fund, Nico Campaign)
- If I draw economy, consider installing Skunkworks + agenda in protected remote
- Keep credits above rez costs (Karunā = 4, Diviner = 2)

---

### Turn 2 - Corp (3 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Palisade (barrier ICE, 3 rez cost, ETR)

**Hand:** Offworld Office, Superconducting Hub, Manegarm Skunkworks, Palisade

**Assessment:**
- CRITICAL: At 3 credits, below Karunā rez threshold (4). R&D is effectively undefended.
- Runner correctly identified this vulnerability - has Jailbreak for multi-access
- Runner at 3 cards in hand - if they run R&D and I rez Karunā, 4 net damage = FLATLINE
- But I can't rez if I don't have 4 credits

**Plan:**
| Take credit (3 → 4)
|| Take credit (4 → 5)
||| Take credit (5 → 6)

**Reasoning:**
Emergency economy turn. Every click for credits gets me above the rez threshold. At 6 credits:
- Can rez Karunā (4) and still have 2 left
- If Runner runs R&D with 3 cards and can't break, they flatline
- This is the best defensive posture available

Didn't draw economy (got Palisade instead), so clicking for credits is mandatory. The Palisade is useful for the remote later but can't afford to install it now.

**Result:** Ended at 6 credits. Threat established: R&D run without breaking Karunā = death.

---

### Turn 3 - Corp (6 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** AMAZE Amusements (upgrade, gives 2 tags on agenda steal)

**Hand:** Offworld Office, Superconducting Hub, Manegarm Skunkworks, Palisade, AMAZE Amusements

**Assessment:**
- Remote is empty (Urtica trashed last turn) - scoring window!
- Runner at 2 credits, Carmen in hand but not installed
- Runner has Overclock (5 temp credits) - can contest with ~7 effective credits
- Palisade on remote = 5 str (gets +2 on remote), costs Cleaver 5c to break

**Plan:**
| Install Palisade on new remote (0 cost) → 6c
|| Install Superconducting Hub (3/1 agenda) (0 cost) → 6c
||| Advance Superconducting Hub (1 cost) → 5c

**Reasoning:**
Going for the 3/1 agenda because it's faster to score. With 1 counter, next turn I can AAA-Score (3 clicks, 3 credits) for 1 point + 2 cards + hand size increase.

Risk: If Runner uses Overclock + Cleaver, they can break Palisade (5c) and steal. But they'd be using their one-shot econ card and wouldn't have follow-up pressure. Worth the risk given how poor they are.

Didn't use Skunkworks or AMAZE - wanted speed over defense this turn. Can layer them on Offworld Office next time.

**Result:** Server 2 has Palisade + Superconducting Hub at 1/3. Have 5 credits (can rez Palisade at 3).

---

### Turn 4 - Corp (5 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Whitespace (code gate ICE)

**Hand:** Offworld Office, Manegarm Skunkworks, AMAZE Amusements, Whitespace

**Assessment:**
- Runner at 0 credits, can't contest
- Superconducting Hub at 1/3, need 2 more advances to score
- This is the scoring window

**Plan:**
| Advance Superconducting Hub (1c) → 4c, 2/3
|| Advance Superconducting Hub (1c) → 3c, 3/3
||| Score (no click cost) + install something

**Execution:**
- Advanced to 3/3, scored Superconducting Hub for 1 point
- Triggered ability: drew 2 cards (Regolith Mining License, Public Trail)
- Used last click to install Regolith in Server 2 (behind Palisade)

**Result:** Corp 1 - 0 Runner. Server 2 now has Palisade + Regolith Mining License. Hand: Offworld Office, Manegarm Skunkworks, AMAZE Amusements, Whitespace, Public Trail.

**Next turn goals:**
- Rez and click Regolith for economy
- Set up scoring remote for Offworld Office (4/2, gives $7 on score)
- Consider Public Trail if Runner makes successful run

---

### Turn 5 - Corp (3 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Seamless Launch (fast advance operation!)

**Hand:** Offworld Office, Manegarm Skunkworks, AMAZE Amusements, Whitespace, Public Trail, Seamless Launch

**Assessment:**
- Seamless Launch + Offworld = 2 points next turn!
- Need economy first (only 3 credits)
- Runner at 4 credits, setting up for big turn 5

**Plan:**
| Rez Regolith (2c) + click it (3c) → 4c
|| Click Regolith (3c) → 7c
||| Install Offworld for Seamless play next turn

**Execution:**
- Rezzed Regolith (2c), loaded with 15c
- Clicked twice for 6c total → 7c
- Installed Offworld Office in Server 3

**CRITICAL MISTAKE:** I installed Offworld in a NEW remote (Server 3) with NO ICE. It's completely unprotected. The Runner can walk in for free and steal 2 points.

I should have:
- Installed Whitespace on Server 3 first, OR
- Installed Offworld in Server 2 behind Palisade

This is a game-losing blunder if Runner punishes it. The only hope is they think it's a trap.

**Result:** 7 credits, naked agenda in Server 3, Regolith at 9c remaining.

---

### Turn 6 - Corp (7 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew (mandatory):** Regolith Mining License (2nd copy)

**Score:** Corp 1 - Runner 2 (Runner stole Offworld from my naked remote)

**Assessment:**
- Behind on points, need to recover
- No agendas in hand - must draw
- Have Seamless Launch but nothing to score

**Plan:**
| Click Regolith (3c) → 10c
|| Draw for agendas
||| Install ICE for future scoring remote

**Execution:**
- Clicked Regolith: 7 → 10 credits
- Drew: Orbital Superiority (4/2 agenda - 4 meat damage if Runner tagged!)
- Installed Whitespace on Server 4

**Analysis:**
Orbital Superiority + Public Trail = potential kill combo:
1. Runner makes successful run
2. Play Public Trail (they get tag or pay $8)
3. Score Orbital, 4 meat damage kills if they have ≤4 cards

Need to set up protected scoring remote for Orbital next turn. Server 4 has Whitespace, will add Manegarm + agenda.

**Result:** 10 credits, Regolith at 6c remaining, Server 4 ready for agenda.

---

### Turn 7 - Corp (6 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Hedge Fund

**Score:** Corp 1 - Runner 5 (Runner stole Send a Message from R&D last turn - MATCH POINT FOR RUNNER)

**Assessment:**
- Desperate situation, need to score and defend
- Runner has NO DECODER - can't break Whitespace on Server 4
- Whitespace ETRs if Runner has ≤6 credits after losing 3

**Plan:**
| Install Orbital in Server 4
|| Seamless Launch (+2 adv)
||| Advance (+1 adv) = 3/4

**Execution:**
- Installed Orbital Superiority in Server 4 (behind Whitespace)
- Played Seamless Launch... **MISTAKE: Seamless says "card you did not install THIS turn"**
- Seamless wasted, chose Done
- Advanced Orbital to 1/4

**Self-critique:** I forgot Seamless Launch's timing restriction. Should have installed Orbital last turn and Seamless'd this turn. Cost me 1 credit and a tempo.

**Result:** Orbital at 1/4, 4 credits. Need 3 more advances = 3 more turns unless I draw another Seamless.

**Hope:** Whitespace should stop Runner if they have ≤6 credits (which they do). They'd need to get to 7+ credits AND find a decoder to contest.

---

### Turn 8 - Corp (4 credits, 3 clicks)

**Drew:** Predictive Planogram (free, gain 3c or draw 3)

**Score:** Corp 1 - Runner 5

**Assessment:**
- Runner found Unity (decoder), now has full breaker suite
- Must score Orbital now or lose tempo
- Orbital at 1/4, need 3 advances (3 credits)

**Plan:**
| Advance Orbital (1c) → 3c, 2/4
|| Advance Orbital (1c) → 2c, 3/4
||| Advance Orbital (1c) → 1c, 4/4 + Score

**Execution:**
- Advanced Orbital 3 times
- Scored Orbital Superiority for 2 points
- Orbital's ability: Runner not tagged, so they receive 1 TAG

**Result:** Corp 3 - Runner 5. Runner is now TAGGED!

**Implications:** With Runner tagged, I have options:
- $2 + click to trash their resources (Smartware Distributor is empty though)
- If I draw another tag source + Orbital... no, I already scored it
- Predictive Planogram does BOTH effects if Runner tagged (gain 3c AND draw 3)

Next turn I need to find more agendas and protect them. At least the tag gives me some leverage.
