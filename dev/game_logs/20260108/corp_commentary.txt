ai-runner
[9:34:33]
 started their turn 1 with 5  and 5 cards in their Grip.

This is a start that is typically very risky to do in tournament play because the unguarded HQ is inviting punishment, if the Runner has it. In the tutorial deck here, I can play more aggressively. The card in the remote is Regolith Mining License, protected by Palisade, with Bran on R&D. I didn't really want to put Bran on R&D - I'd rather have it on the remote, but them's the breaks. R&D is fine as a 2nd pick.

However, it's mostly a bluff. I can't afford to rez it, and even if I had 1 more credit and could I wouldn't. I need to get the License printing $. Palisade is way better on remotes since it hard ETRs AND has +str, so that's an easy pick.

The coward's line here is to put Palisade on HQ and take a credit, I suspect.

This was... unfortunate from the corp pov. I wouldn't have installed Unity blind though. Every credit counts! Note that the facecheck from the runner paid out pretty hard here. Who needs a face, anyway, that's what I say.

The upgrade in the server doesn't actually help. Yet. I think I should have clicked the License the 3rd time here.

And that's the upgrade revealed, and the Runner now has a rig of Cleaver & Unity. But they're super broke, with only $1. It'd be nice if they'd let me get another $9 - I'm really regretting the install.

ai-runner

Runner is digging _hard_ for something. Checking their trajectory, it's $. And they didn't find it soon - although the VRcation likely found it. Now, I was paying close attention to the discards.

Let's see that again in slow-mo.

discards... Cleaver, Unity

Retribution

Play only if the Runner is tagged.

Trash 1 installed program or piece of hardware.

Did you really think youʼd get away with it?
==
which was actually why I installed the upgrade. With no ICE on HQ, I thought it'd be safer in the remote (well the Runner found Cleaver...).

But now: path to victory located. If I can find out where this punk lives, I'll send the boys round and that console's running days are _over_. Cleaver's the top pick because of the Palisade (barriers tend to just ETR mostly). They do have 2 Mayfly, so I'm still not 100% safe. No one is with that bastard around.

This was why I advanced it last turn. I thought they'd have to get lucky to get in - e.g. their last card includes Overclock, and even then I'd tag them. Now I have one click remaining.

ai-runner

Trouble with Wildcat Strike is you have to play it when both sides suck for the Corp. The Runner already dug to Australia, I'll let them dig further. Downside: they'll find Mayfly most likely now or soon. But there's absolutely no way I'm giving them $6 when I have such an econ adv.

The Seamless wasn't so much for stealth as simple cash, because $4 when I have Bran out is grossly insufficient.

If this was a single access, I probabvly wouldn't have rezzed it since it takes me to $1. But cutting off double access plus a card was too juicy to miss. Sadly I didn't have an ICE to install :/

This is a huge problem for the Runner. If they contest it, they'll blow all their $, and they don't know what the ICE is. AMAZE doesn't help at least (it only fires on agenda steals, not trashes).

I can't say I blame them, I often trash ciphers too because they're so annoying. Hugely expensive here though, and means I might draw an agenda (I think I did actually). Note STILL no ICE on HQ :sunglasses:
However, they spent their _entire turn_ and $2 on this. I don't think you do it unless it's the 2nd Jailbreak. This is why Bran's so great. Your whole turn might not sound like that much but Netrunner games often go to 12 turns or sth, so it's a big chunk of the total clicks.

The Runner can now make two (2) runs on the remote, thanks to Palisade. Until then, Orbital Superiority can't getcha. I don't think I even clear the tags yet, if at all. But the Runner has probably lost at this point - the Bran run lost too much tempo. It's not over yet though!
