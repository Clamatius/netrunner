### User Input

Hi! I realize you're probably expecting code. How about some cards instead! We have an implementation of the modernized version of Garfield's classic, Netrunner, a complex, challenging card game.

Your instructions on how to play as the Runner side are at /Users/mcooper/workspace/netrunner/dev/instructions/target/runner_instructions.md

I have the game set up. I shall be playing the Corp side via the Jinteki web UI - you have send_command, a text_based UI.

Tips:

* Once we start playing, you'll need to use the wait-for-relevant-diff with cursor pattern to keep going without me having to restart the session constantly (and each time you might see hidden info).

* You will call send_command directly as a bash tool. It has many options to help smooth the path - e.g. for runs with no hidden info, use the --options available.

* We'll be playing the Tutorial (Intermediate) level, 7 point wins and 40 card fixed decks.

Any clarifying questions before you start running the nets?


### Planner Response

Got it. Before we start, I’m going to do two quick things:

- Read your Runner-side instructions at `dev/instructions/target/runner_instructions.md` so I follow your intended play protocol.
- Confirm what command interface is actually available in this IDE session (you mention `send_command` and `wait-for-relevant-diff`; I want to align that with the tools I can call here).

I’ll start by opening the instructions file now.

### Planner Response

## What I’m doing next
I’ve read the Runner instructions and I’ll follow the **cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since $CURSOR`** pattern once we’re in-game to avoid desync/hidden info leaks.

Next I need to confirm the exact CLI surface of `dev/send_command` in *this* workspace (exact subcommands, whether `help` is global vs per-side, how to join/resync your already-created game). I’ll run the help commands (read-only) and then we can connect to the active tutorial match.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I’m going to inspect the authoritative CLI help for `dev/send_command` (Runner side) so I know the exact subcommands for connecting/resyncing and the precise syntax for `list-lobbies`, `status`, `get-cursor`, and `wait-for-relevant-diff`. Then we’ll use that to attach to your already-running tutorial game without revealing hidden info.

`./dev/send_command runner help`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to pull the **full** `send_command` help so I can see the lobby/join/resync commands (they weren’t shown in the short help). Then I’ll use those to attach to your already-created Tutorial (Intermediate) game and we’ll start taking Runner actions using the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` pattern.

`./dev/send_command help --full`*

`./dev/send_command runner list-lobbies`*

### Planner Response

`list-lobbies` failed because the script wrapper calls `timeout`, which isn’t available by default on macOS. I’m going to patch the wrapper (`dev/ai-eval.sh`) to

### User Input

Apologies to pause. You shouldn't need to patch anything, that means we have a bug. It actually seems to be an environment issue. I'd had to reinstall Homebrew earlier today to switch the intel => mac stuff over and the migration didn't work properly. But send_command was working without errors for me, so I went to try to figure out why. timeout is in my PATH, for example. I bounced the IDE in the hopes of picking up the new shell settings. Does send_command work now?

*Updated todo list*

`command -v timeout && timeout 1s echo ok`*

`./dev/send_command runner list-lobbies`*

### Planner Response

`send_command` works now: `timeout` is found in PATH, and `list-lobbies` returned your already-started game.

Next I’ll:
- `resync` the Runner client into game `d9c50671-790a-4c7d-98e6-65b8cec6f164`
- pull `status` + `prompt` so we know whether we’re at a mulligan, start-turn, or mid-run decision point

Then we’ll start playing Runner turns using the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` pattern.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

I’ve got us resynced, we mulliganed into a strong opener (`Sure Gamble`, `Creative Commission`, plus `Unity`+`Cleaver`). Right now it’s **Corp turn 1**, so I’m going to wait (using the cursor pattern) until something relevant happens (their turn ends or a prompt appears for us).

`./dev/send_command runner board`*

`./dev/send_command runner start-turn`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to take our first Runner turn with a simple, tempo-positive line:
- **Click 1**: `Sure Gamble` (get rich without losing tempo)
- **Click 2**: Install `Unity` (so we can contest likely early code gates)
- **Click 3**: Probe **R&D** (force rez / get info / maybe steal)
- **Click 4**: `Creative Commission` (last click to avoid losing a click)

I’ll run the R&D probe manually (no fast auto-continue), and if we hit a “waiting on Corp to rez/act” window I’ll use `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to synchronize.

`./dev/send_command runner run "R&D" --no-continue`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to advance the run step-by-step with `continue` so we can react to whatever the unrezzed R&D ICE is (rez window, then encounter decisions). If we hit a “waiting on Corp” window, I’ll use `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to synchronize before issuing the next command.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

Corp has priority to rez the R&D ICE right now, so I’m going to grab the current cursor and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` until their rez (or no-rez) decision comes through. Then I’ll respond to the resulting encounter prompt (break with `Unity` if it’s a code gate, otherwise assess whether we can safely tank/jack out later).

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 17`*

### Planner Response

We’re still in the rez window on the R&D ICE (Corp decision point). I’m going to check the current prompt/state, then keep waiting with a fresh cursor so we don’t miss their rez/no-rez response.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to check the run state/prompt right now (it looks like we’ve advanced to the movement phase and are waiting on the Corp’s paid-ability window). Then I’ll use the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` pattern until their window closes, and we can proceed to access.

### Planner Response

I’m going to check whether the steal resolved cleanly (no follow-up prompts like tags or “access additional cards”), then use our last click to play `Creative Commission` as planned, and end the turn. After that I’ll switch to the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for the Corp’s turn.

### Planner Response

## Runner Turn 2 — plan
Board/state recap:

- **You (Runner):** 10¢, `Unity` installed, 2 cards in hand, 2/7 points.
- **Corp:** rezzed **Regolith Mining License** in `Server 1`, now on **9¢**, with ICE on `R&D` and `Server 1` (both unrezzed so far).

Given Regolith is a big econ engine, I want to **trash it ASAP** if we can get in without risking death / total bankruptcy. But we also can’t run blindly with only **2 cards in grip** (trap/damage risk), and we should respect the **4¢ floor**.

### Proposed line (safe, then contest)
- **Click 1:** `draw` (we need cards before running a remote that could hide damage/trap lines)
- Re-evaluate:
  - If we draw into econ or more draw, consider drawing again.
  - If hand gets to ~4-5 and we’re still ≥4¢ after a run, **run Server 1** to trash Regolith if accessible.

I’m going to start the turn, then take **Click 1 = draw**, and show you the new hand before deciding whether to contest `Server 1` this turn.

### User Input

oops, you stopped. trying not to read what you were saying. if you use the cursor & wait plan, I don't have to alt-tab to you, because my turns are done in <10s.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I’ll keep the session moving without you needing to alt-tab: I’m going to immediately start Runner turn 2, take two quick draws (to avoid running a remote with a tiny grip), then facecheck `Server 1` to try to trash the rezzed `Regolith Mining License`. I’ll use the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` pattern whenever we hit a Corp rez/response window.

### Planner Response

Continuing the `Server 1` run step-by-step. I’ll pause at any Corp rez/response window and use `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so you don’t have to babysit the session.

### Planner Response

Continuing the `Server 1` run: Corp has rezzed `Palisade`, so I’m going to move into the encounter, check `Cleaver`’s available “Fully break Palisade” ability, break it, then proceed to access and (if affordable) trash `Regolith Mining License`.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at the `Palisade` encounter decision. Next I’ll:
- query `abilities "Cleaver"` to find the “Fully break Palisade” option
- execute that ability, then `continue` into access
- on access, trash `Regolith Mining License` if offered and we can pay the trash cost (we’re on 7¢ now).

### Planner Response

Continuing the run from the movement phase into server access. If we hit a “waiting on Corp paid abilities” window, I’ll immediately switch to `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` until it clears, then handle access/trash decisions.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

Accessing `Regolith Mining License` first; if the prompt offers trashing, I’m going to pay to trash it (it’s their main econ engine), then access the second card and finish the access sequence.

### Planner Response

Finishing the `Server 1` access (no action on `AMAZE Amusements`), which should end the run/turn cleanly. Then I’ll immediately switch back to cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to follow the Corp’s fast turn without you needing to alt-tab.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to keep the game moving by watching for the Corp to start their next turn. I’ll re-check `status` to confirm we’re in the “waiting for Corp” state, then immediately go back into `wait-for-relevant-diff --since <cursor>` (longer timeout). If it still doesn’t advance, I’ll send a `ping` to nudge the UI sync.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 10`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

I’m synced and it’s now **Corp turn 3** (they’ve done the mandatory draw; they’re at 6¢ and 3 clicks). I’ll just sit in the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop until something relevant happens (their turn ends, they start a run interaction/prompt for us, etc.).

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 52`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to check what changed on Corp turn 3 after the cursor advance, then either keep waiting (if they still have actions) or start our Runner turn (if it’s passed to us). I’ll stay in the `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop so you don’t need to alt-tab.

`./dev/send_command runner draw`*

`./dev/send_command runner draw`*

### Planner Response

You’re on Runner turn 3 with **2 clicks left** and only **1¢**, so you can’t realistically contest the advanced `Server 1` card through `Palisade` this turn. I’m going to spend the remaining clicks **drawing for economy** (looking for `Sure Gamble` / `Creative Commission` / `Overclock`), then `smart-end-turn`, and immediately go back into the **cursor + wait-for-relevant-diff** loop for the Corp’s fast turn.

`./dev/send_command runner draw`*

`./dev/send_command runner play "VRcation"`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to handle the **end-of-turn discard prompt** from `VRcation` (we’re at 9 cards, need to discard down to 5) so your Corp turn can proceed immediately. I’ll inspect the current prompt + hand, then `multi-choose` the 4 discards and return to the cursor-based wait loop.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner hand`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner choose-card 3`*

### Planner Response

I’m in the discard prompt. The `choose-card` selection went through but the UI didn’t immediately advance (it only advances after we’ve selected enough cards and then confirm `Done`). I’m going to re-check the prompt, then select the remaining 3 discards and finish with `choose 0` (`Done`) so the Corp can start turn 4 without waiting.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner discard "Verbal Plasticity" "Cleaver" "Unity" "Red Team"`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to finish the end-of-turn discard cleanly using the select prompt mechanics: select 3 more cards to discard via `choose-card`, then re-check whether the prompt clears (it should once 4 cards are selected). If it doesn’t auto-resolve, I’ll then try the prompt’s lone `choose 0` option to finalize.

### Planner Response

Corp is now on **turn 4** (mandatory draw done). Your end-of-turn discard is resolved and we’re fully unblocked.

I’m going to go back into the **cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since`** loop and just keep advancing as you take your (fast) Corp actions. When it becomes my turn (or a prompt appears), I’ll immediately act so you don’t have to alt-tab.

### User Input

ah, except you didn't. your turn 4.

### Planner Response

I’m going to re-sync to the *current* game state (`status`/`prompt`) right now—if it’s actually Runner turn 4, I’ll immediately take actions and then return to the cursor-based wait loop.

I’ve played `Wildcat Strike` and we’re now blocked on the Corp choosing between “gain 6” vs “draw 4”. I’m going to switch into the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop until their choice resolves, then I’ll immediately finish our turn and return to waiting.

I’m going to make sure your Corp isn’t blocked by our end-of-turn hand size: the game says we’re over hand size but didn’t surface a discard prompt yet. I’ll explicitly `end-turn` to force the discard prompt to appear, discard 2 cards down to 5, then switch back to the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for your Corp turn.

### Planner Response

We’re good now:

- **Runner turn 4 is fully resolved** (including the forced draw from `Wildcat Strike` and the end-of-turn discard).
- It’s now **Corp turn 5**, they’ve already done their **mandatory draw**, and we’re unblocked.

I’m going to sit in the cursor-based loop again so your Corp clicks can fly by without you alt-tabbing:

- Current cursor: `85`
- Next: `wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 85` and repeat until it becomes my turn or a prompt appears.

### User Input

ah, except you didn't actually run wait-for-relevant-diff again, you just said you would. your turn 5.

### Planner Response

I’m going to stop narrating and just execute: I’ll re-check `status` to see whether it’s already Runner turn 5, and then immediately either (a) `wait-for-relevant-diff --since <cursor>` if Corp is still acting, or (b) `start-turn` if it’s on me.

I’m going to resync the exact current state (turn/clicks/prompt). If it’s Runner turn 8, I’ll immediately take actions (econ first), then end turn and go straight into `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` for your fast Corp turn.

### Planner Response

I’m going to fix the sequencing issue from the earlier parallel commands (the `Telework Contract` ability call raced the install). Next I’ll:
- Check current `status`
- Use `Telework Contract` for +3 credits with the last click (if it’s installed)
- End the turn and immediately re-enter the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for Corp’s fast turn.

### User Input

looks like you got stuck somehow. over to you for your turn 11

### Planner Response

I’ll resync the game state (`status`/`prompt`/`log`) to see where we are, then immediately take my Runner actions for turn 11 (or, if it’s still Corp turn, I’ll re-enter the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff` loop). Also fixing my earlier “stuck” behavior by avoiding large parallel reads when the game is mid-transition.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I’ll unstick by doing a minimal single-command resync (`status` → `prompt` → `log`) and then immediately take Runner turn 11 actions based on the exact current clicks/credits/tags, ending with the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner start-turn`*

### Planner Response

I see we’re at the “start Runner turn” boundary and my `start-turn` call errored. I’ll re-check `status`/`prompt` to confirm whether the turn actually started (sometimes it succeeds but returns oddly), then retry `start-turn` once and proceed with Runner turn 11 actions.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 8`*

### User Input

hmm it never did come unstuck. I wondered if some timeout'd hit in the end. welp, we'll see if that persists. it's your turn 11.

### Planner Response

I’ll unstick this by doing **single, sequential** `send_command` calls (no parallel) to (1) verify we’re still at “start Runner turn”, (2) retry `start-turn`, and if it still errors, (3) run `resync` and retry.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

I’m going to run a minimal sequence now: `status` → `start-turn`. If `start-turn` still fails, I’ll run `resync` and then `start-turn` again so we can take Runner turn 11 actions.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to diagnose why `./dev/send_command` suddenly returns exit code `1` with no output by:
- Verifying the terminal tool itself works (`echo`).
- Running `send_command` through `zsh -f` (no shell init) to avoid the recurring `compinit/_brew` startup issue.
Once that works, I’ll use the same wrapper to take Runner turn 11 immediately.

`echo TOOL_OK`*

`zsh -f -c './dev/send_command runner status'`*

### Planner Response

The command runner itself is failing right now (even `echo` returned exit code 1 with no output), so I can’t currently drive turn 11 via `send_command`. I’m going to try one command again **without auto-run** (so you can explicitly approve it) to see if this is an execution/approval glitch.

`echo TOOL_OK`*

### Planner Response

## Blocker: I can’t execute *any* shell commands right now
At the moment, `run_command` is failing hard: even `echo TOOL_OK` returns **exit code 1 with no output**, so I can’t drive `./dev/send_command` to take Runner turn 11.

This looks like a tooling/session issue (not a Netrunner/game-state issue), similar to when a shell/extension state gets wedged.

## What I need from you (fastest path)
Please run these **in your own terminal** from the repo root ([/Users/mcooper/workspace/netrunner](file:///Users/mcooper/workspace/netrunner:0:0-0:0)) and paste the outputs here:

```bash
./dev/send_command runner status
./dev/send_command runner prompt
./dev/send_command runner hand
./dev/send_command runner board
```

Then I’ll tell you **exactly** what Runner turn 11 actions to execute (in order), and we can keep going with minimal back-and-forth.

## If those commands also fail for you
Try a quick restart of the IDE (or whatever provides the command execution bridge) and then rerun:

```bash
./dev/send_command runner status
```

## Status
- **Gameplay**: Paused; I’m unable to issue Runner turn 11 actions due to command execution failing.
- **Next step**: You paste the four command outputs above, and I’ll continue turn 11 immediately.

### User Input

Bounced the IDE and yep it works now. I think it was more fallout from the homebrew snafu most likely. I tried send_command from a shell in the IDE so it's likely it'll work. I'll hang around for a status call from you to confirm though

### Planner Response

I’ll confirm the tooling is unstuck by running `./dev/send_command runner status` (and `prompt` if needed). If we’re at the start of Runner turn 11, I’ll immediately take my actions and then drop back into the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop.

### Planner Response

I’m going to use this turn to get out from under the remaining tag (to stop more punishment like Retribution), then use `Mutual Favor` to tutor a replacement barrier breaker (since Cleaver got trashed), and finish with a couple `take-credit`s to rebuild.

`./dev/send_command runner remove-tag`*

`./dev/send_command runner play "Mutual Favor"`*

`./dev/send_command runner choose 1`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to finish resolving `Mutual Favor`, then spend the remaining clicks on credits, end turn, and immediately go back into the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for your Corp turn.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’ll use the remaining 2 clicks on `take-credit` twice (we’re at 0 credits), ending the turn cleanly, then I’ll grab the cursor and go back into `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` for your Corp turn.

`./dev/send_command runner take-credit`*

### Planner Response

Taking the last click for `take-credit`, then I’ll immediately `get-cursor` and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to hand it back to Corp without stalling.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 30`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

### Planner Response

I’ll sit in the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop so your Corp turn can proceed instantly. If anything requires a Runner decision, I’ll respond immediately.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 12`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to start Runner turn 12, then make an immediate run on `R&D` so I can spend my clicks to click through `Brân 1.0` again. After the access, I’ll reassess econ (likely `take-credit` if clicks remain) and then hand back to Corp with the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop.

`./dev/send_command runner start-turn`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to execute the R&D run now and use the cursor+`wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop at each Corp decision point (rezzes / paid ability windows). I’ll respond immediately to any prompts (icebreak/bioroid clicks/access).

`./dev/send_command runner run rd --no-continue`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run now. I’ll `continue` through the run and use the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` whenever we hit a Corp rez/decision window.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at the Corp rez window on the outer R&D ICE. I’ll grab the cursor and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so we immediately react to the rez/continue decision, then proceed through the encounter and access.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 242`*

### Planner Response

I’m still at the outer R&D ICE rez window. I’ll resync `status`/`prompt` to confirm we’re waiting on a Corp rez decision; if so, I’ll stay in the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop until it advances, then proceed immediately through the encounter.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to read `Tithe` text, then continue the run and choose the cheapest line that still gets us through to R&D access (saving credits/clicks where possible).

`./dev/send_command runner card-text "Tithe"`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to continue into the `Tithe` encounter, check the break/tank prompt, and use `Mayfly` to prevent the net damage (keeping our hand intact) while spending as little as possible, then continue toward `Brân 1.0` and the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to break the `Tithe` net damage subroutine with `Mayfly` (leave the corp +1 credit sub to fire), then continue to `Brân 1.0` and click through its subs to reach the R&D access this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner abilities "Mayfly"`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to break only the *net damage* sub on `Tithe` with `Mayfly` (spending 1 credit), let the Corp gain 1 credit, then continue to `Brân 1.0` and spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all three of its subs and access R&D.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

### Planner Response

Breaking the `Tithe` net damage sub with `Mayfly`, then we’ll continue the run into `Brân 1.0` and click-break all 3 subs to get the R&D access this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner use-ability "Mayfly" 0`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to check the new prompt from `Mayfly` (it should ask which `Tithe` subroutine to break), select the *net damage* sub, then continue through the rest of the run into `Brân 1.0` and click-break its subs to reach the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Breaking the `Do 1 net damage` subroutine on `Tithe` now, then I’ll finish the encounter (leaving the Corp +1 credit to fire) and continue the run toward `Brân 1.0` and the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

### Planner Response

I’ll finish resolving the `Tithe` encounter (hit `Done`, then `tank` to let the remaining “gain 1 credit” sub fire), then continue to `Brân 1.0` and spend 3 clicks to click-break all its subs so we can access R&D this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to finish the `Tithe` encounter by choosing `Done` and then `tank "Tithe"` to let the remaining “gain 1 credit” sub fire, then continue into `Brân 1.0` and spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all three of its subroutines so we can access R&D this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner choose 1`*

`./dev/send_command runner tank "Tithe"`*

### Planner Response

I’ve authorized letting the remaining `Tithe` sub fire; next I’ll `continue` through the movement window into `Brân 1.0`, then spend 3 clicks to click-break all its subroutines and access R&D this turn (cursor+wait at any Corp windows).

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the active R&D run: I’m going to `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` the cursor I just grabbed to let the tanked `Tithe` sub resolve, then `continue` into `Brân 1.0` and spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all its subroutines and access R&D.

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 249`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to resync the active run (`status` + `prompt`) to see what window we’re in after tanking `Tithe`, then immediately `continue` into `Brân 1.0` and click-break its subroutines to reach the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 8`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run: I’ll `continue` to fully pass `Tithe`, then at `Brân 1.0` I’ll spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all three subroutines and complete the run to access R&D.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to use the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop to clear this movement paid-ability window, then proceed to the inner R&D ICE (`Brân 1.0`) and click-break all its subroutines to get the R&D access this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run: I’ll `wait-for-relevant-diff --since 251` to let the movement window clear, then handle `Brân 1.0` by click-breaking its subs and proceed to the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 251`*

### Planner Response

Resyncing the active R&D run after the cursor advance, then I’ll proceed into `Brân 1.0` and click-break its subs to reach the access.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 10`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to continue into the `Brân 1.0` encounter, then spend my remaining 3 clicks to use its bioroid ability to break all 3 subroutines (choosing the install-ICE sub first, then the two ETRs), and then complete the run to access R&D.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

Breaking `Brân 1.0` by spending all 3 remaining clicks to click-break each subroutine (install-ICE sub first, then both ETRs), then continuing to the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to spend my remaining 3 clicks on `Brân 1.0`’s bioroid ability to break all three subroutines (starting with the install-ICE sub), then hit `continue` to breach R&D and resolve the access prompt(s).

`./dev/send_command runner use-runner-ability "Brân 1.0" 0`*

### Planner Response

I’ve spent 1 click to click-break a `Brân 1.0` subroutine; now I’ll resync `prompt/status` and finish click-breaking the remaining two subs, then `continue` to breach R&D and resolve the access.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to use the active “Break a subroutine” prompt to click-break the *install-ICE* sub first, then spend my remaining 2 clicks to click-break both `End the run` subs, hit `Done`, and `continue` to breach R&D and resolve the access prompt.

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to finish click-breaking the two remaining `End the run` subs on `Brân 1.0`, then hit `Done` and proceed to the R&D access prompt.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run: I’ll `continue` to pass the fully-broken `Brân 1.0`, resolve the R&D access prompt, then (with 0 clicks) let the turn end and immediately go back to the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for Corp.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at the movement paid-ability window after passing `Brân 1.0`. I’ll grab the cursor and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to clear the Corp window; then I’ll resolve the R&D access prompt (if any), and immediately drop back into the cursor+wait loop for the Corp turn.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Continuing the active R&D run: I’ll `wait-for-relevant-diff --since 263` to clear the Corp paid-ability window, then resolve the R&D access prompt and end back in the cursor-based wait loop for the Corp turn.

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 263`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to resync `status`/`prompt` to see what run window we’re stuck in, then `continue` to push the run to the R&D breach/access (using cursor+`wait-for-relevant-diff --since` if a Corp window appears).

I’ll resync `status`/`prompt` to confirm the steal resolved, our agenda total updated (this should put us very close to 7), and that the run/turn fully ended. Then I’ll grab a cursor and go straight into `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` for the Corp’s next turn.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 12`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to hit `continue` to clear the “waiting for Corp pending triggers” window after stealing `Send a Message`, then I’ll grab a cursor and re-enter `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so the Corp can take their next turn without stalling.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

Clearing the “pending triggers” window with `continue`, then I’ll immediately `wait-for-relevant-diff --since 266` to hand priority back to Corp and stay responsive to any prompts.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to resync `status`/`prompt` to confirm the run fully ended after the agenda steal (the earlier `continue` likely hit after the run closed), then I’ll grab a cursor and sit in `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so your Corp turn proceeds without interruption.

Starting Runner turn 13 and immediately running R&D: I’ll tank `Tithe` (take 1 net damage, let Corp gain 1 credit), then spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all `Brân 1.0` subroutines and access R&D—this is our best shot to steal the winning agenda at `6/7`.

`./dev/send_command runner start-turn`*

`./dev/send_command runner run rd --no-continue`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run: I’ll advance through the approach/encounter windows, tank `Tithe` (accepting 1 net damage), then spend the remaining clicks to click-break `Brân 1.0` and access R&D for the potential winning steal.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run from the current initiation prompt: I’ll `continue` into `Tithe`, then **tank** it (take 1 net damage), and use my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all `Brân 1.0` subs and access R&D for the potential game-winning steal.

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at an R&D run paid-ability window. I’ll grab the cursor and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so we immediately react when the Corp passes/rezes, then I’ll proceed into `Tithe` and follow the planned tank line into `Brân 1.0` and the R&D access.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 281`*

### Planner Response

Resyncing the active R&D run after the cursor advance, then I’ll proceed into `Tithe` and **tank it** (take 1 net damage), and finally spend my 3 remaining clicks to click-break `Brân 1.0` and access R&D for the potential winning agenda.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 8`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to `continue` past the already-resolved `Tithe`, then proceed to `Brân 1.0` and spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all three subs and access R&D (we’re at `6/7`, so any 1-point agenda wins).

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to clear the movement paid-ability window (cursor+wait), then continue into `Brân 1.0`, spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all its subroutines, and access R&D looking for the winning 1-point agenda.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 285`*

### Planner Response

Resyncing the run state (`status`/`prompt`) after the movement window, then I’ll continue into `Brân 1.0`, spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break all its subs, and resolve the R&D access (going for the winning point at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner log 8`*

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at a movement paid-ability window mid-run on R&D. I’ll use the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop to clear Corp priority, then proceed into `Brân 1.0`, spend my remaining 3 clicks to click-break its subs, and resolve the R&D access for the potential winning steal.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 285`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to stop looping on `wait-for-relevant-diff` here and instead **push the run forward** by checking `prompt`/`status`; if we’re still in the movement paid-ability window, I’ll explicitly `continue` to pass priority. Then we’ll hit `Brân 1.0`, click-break all 3 subs (spending our 3 remaining clicks), and access R&D for the potential game-winning steal.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at the `Brân 1.0` encounter with **3 clicks available**—perfect. I’ll click-break all 3 subroutines (install-ICE first, then both ETRs), then push through to the R&D access. If we see an agenda, we’ll steal for the win at `6/7`.

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner use-runner-ability "Brân 1.0" 0`*

### Planner Response

I’ve spent 1 click on `Brân 1.0`’s bioroid ability; next I’ll use the “Break a subroutine” prompt to select and break each sub (install-ICE first, then both ETRs), then `continue` to breach R&D and resolve the access (steal if agenda).

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Finishing the `Brân 1.0` encounter: I’ll click-break the remaining two `End the run` subs, then `Done`, then `continue` to breach R&D and resolve the access (steal if it’s an agenda to win at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

### Planner Response

Breaking the final `End the run` subroutine on `Brân 1.0`, then I’ll hit `Done`, `continue` to breach R&D, and steal any agenda we see to close the game (we’re at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Breaking the last `End the run` sub on `Brân 1.0` now, then I’ll push through to the R&D access and steal if it’s an agenda (that should win at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to `Done` out of the Brân subroutine prompt (if needed), `continue` to breach R&D, then resolve the access prompt immediately (steal any agenda to win at `7`).

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Pushing the run to completion now: I’ll `continue` past the fully-broken `Brân 1.0`, resolve the R&D access prompt immediately, and if it’s an agenda I’ll steal it to win (we’re at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to clear the post-ICE movement paid-ability window (cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since`), then resolve the R&D access prompt immediately. If the accessed card is an agenda, I’ll steal it to win (we’re at `6/7`).

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Clearing the current R&D run movement window: I’ll grab the cursor, `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` to let Corp pass any paid abilities, then I’ll resolve the R&D access prompt immediately (steal if agenda for the win).

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 298`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to push the run forward (instead of waiting) by resyncing `prompt/status` and issuing `continue` to pass the movement paid-ability window. That should take us to the R&D breach/access prompt, where I’ll immediately steal if it’s an agenda (to win at `6/7`).

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

Resolving the R&D access (`Hedge Fund` has no action), which will finish the run/turn. Then I’ll immediately grab cursor and go into `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` for the Corp’s next turn.

`./dev/send_command runner choose 0`*

### Planner Response

I’ve resolved the R&D access (`Hedge Fund` → `No action`). I’m going to grab the cursor and drop straight into `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so your Corp turn can proceed immediately.

### Planner Response

I’ll resync the current game state (status/board/hand), start Runner turn 14, and then pick a line aimed at getting us that last agenda point—most likely pressuring R&D again, but we need to see what the new outer R&D ICE is and whether we can realistically get through it with our current rig/credits.

### Planner Response

I’m going to take Runner turn 14 by immediately making an R&D run (we’re at `6/7`, so any agenda steal wins). I’ll preserve my 3 remaining clicks to click-break `Brân 1.0` again, and only change course if the new outer R&D ICE makes the run impossible this turn.

`./dev/send_command runner start-turn`*

`./dev/send_command runner run rd --no-continue`*

### Planner Response

Continuing the R&D run: I’ll advance through the outer unrezzed R&D ICE, respond to any rez/encounter prompts, and if we get in to `Brân 1.0` I’ll spend my remaining clicks to click-break its subs and access R&D for the winning steal.

Continuing Runner turn 14 R&D run: I’ll `continue` through approach windows, respond to any rez/encounter prompts on the outer R&D ICE, then click-break `Brân 1.0` with remaining clicks and resolve the R&D access (steal any agenda to win).

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m at the Corp rez window on the outer R&D ICE. I’ll grab the cursor and `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` so we immediately react to the rez/pass decision, then proceed through the encounter toward `Brân 1.0` and the access.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 313`*

### Planner Response

I’m still paused at the Corp rez window on the **outer R&D ICE**. I’ll resync `status`/`prompt` to confirm we’re waiting on a rez/no-rez decision, then I’ll immediately re-enter the cursor-based `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop until it advances (and then I’ll handle the encounter and push through to the R&D access for the potential game-winning steal).

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to resync `status`/`prompt`/`log` to see whether the R&D run is still active (the “not in a run” response suggests it may have already ended on Palisade). Then I’ll choose the best click-efficient line for the rest of Runner turn 14.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to check `Karunā`’s text and our current playable options to decide if a high-pressure `HQ` run (to steal the last point) is safe, since `R&D` is now locked behind `Palisade` and we don’t have a barrier breaker.

### Planner Response

I saw the cursor advance; I’m going to resync (`status`/`prompt`/`log`) to see what the Corp did and whether it’s now Runner turn 15. If it’s my turn, I’ll act immediately; otherwise I’ll continue the cursor+wait loop.

I’m going to start Runner turn 15 and take the only plausible “win now” line available without breakers: **run Archives** (often unprotected, and if any agenda ended up there we can steal to hit `7/7`). If Archives is empty, I’ll pivot to drawing aggressively for a barrier breaker / access tool while we’re on match point.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

`./dev/send_command runner continue`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to clear the Archives run movement window (cursor+wait), then resolve the Archives breach/access. If there’s any agenda in Archives we steal immediately to win at `7/7`; if not, I’ll use remaining clicks to draw/install to rebuild barrier access.

`./dev/send_command runner get-cursor`*

`./dev/send_command runner wait-for-relevant-diff 30 --since 332`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to resync `status`/`prompt` for the Archives run, then `continue` to breach Archives and resolve any access prompts. If Archives is empty (no agendas), I’ll use remaining clicks to set up (likely install `DZMZ Optimizer` and/or draw) for a barrier solution so we can contest R&D/remote again.

`./dev/send_command runner status`*

`./dev/send_command runner prompt`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to use the remaining 3 clicks on Runner turn 15 to set up for the final point: install `DZMZ Optimizer` (so our next breaker install is cheaper), then install `Leech` as our first program this turn for a discount, then draw once to dig for a barrier solution / win line. After that I’ll end turn and go back to the cursor+wait loop.

`./dev/send_command runner install "DZMZ Optimizer"`*

### Planner Response

I’m going to finish Runner turn 15 setup: install `Leech` (discounted by `DZMZ Optimizer`), draw 1 to dig for a barrier solution/win line, then end turn and immediately go back into the cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` loop for Corp’s next turn.

`./dev/send_command runner install "Leech"`*

### Planner Response

Using the last click on Runner turn 15 to `draw` (digging for a barrier breaker / win line), then I’ll immediately hand back to Corp via `get-cursor` + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since`.

I’m going to resync Runner turn 16 (`hand`/`board`) and read `VRcation` so we can choose the best “don’t lose next turn / find the last point” line—either a fast draw/econ burst into a barrier breaker, or a risky central run if it can win immediately.

I’ve played `VRcation` and now need to see what we drew. Next I’ll check `hand` and `list-playables`, then spend remaining 2 clicks either installing a barrier solution if we found one (best), or taking credits / drawing to prep for a decisive run next turn (Corp is also on match point).

`./dev/send_command runner take-credit`*

### Planner Response

Resolving the end-of-turn discard prompt now (we’re at 6 cards). I’ll check `prompt` to see selectable cards, discard one `Carmen`, then immediately go back to cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since` for the Corp turn.

### Planner Response

## Result
- **Game ended**: `Clamatius wins the game.`
- **Final score**:
  - **Runner (me)**: `6 / 7`
  - **Corp (you)**: `8 / 7` (Corp hit the win condition)
- **Winning sequence (from log)**:
  - You played **`Orbital Superiority`** (gave me `1` tag)
  - Then the game reported **Corp victory**
  - You revealed HQ: `Government Subsidy`, `Nico Campaign`, `Seamless Launch`, `Tithe`, `Whitespace`

## Quick recap of where we were
- I reached **match point** at `6/7` by stealing **`Send a Message`** from R&D earlier.
- After R&D got re-iced with **`Palisade`**, I couldn’t keep accessing (no barrier breaker online and too low on credits), which gave you time to close.

## Status
Task complete: the Netrunner run is over (Corp victory).

### User Input

gg GPT. Genuinely impressive. You came very close - without the tag punishment fork I think I'd have been in big trouble. It seemed like there were a few technical issues - e.g. Mutual Favor's output being in Clojure - anything else?
Feedback on the tactical instructions? Anything you'd change given your experience?

*Updated todo list*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

## Technical issues I hit (and what I’d tweak)

- **`run_command`/IDE execution getting “stuck”**
  - **Symptom**: `run_command` started returning exit code `1` with *no output*, even for `echo`, until you bounced the IDE.
  - **Likely cause**: IDE shell/session environment wedged (consistent with the Homebrew migration / PATH fallout).
  - **Suggestion**:
    - Add a short “if commands return exit 1/no output, restart IDE” troubleshooting note to the instructions.
    - If possible, have `send_command` print a clear error when it can’t spawn subprocesses / loses its runtime deps, rather than silent fail.

- **Shell init noise (`compinit... _brew`)**
  - **Symptom**: Frequent `compinit:.../_brew` warning noise in outputs.
  - **Suggestion**:
    - Not required for function, but cleaning the zsh completion path or ensuring `_brew` completion exists would reduce noise (helps both humans and an agent parsing output).
    - Alternatively, have `send_command` run under a minimal shell environment if you control how it’s invoked.

- **Dependent actions sent in parallel caused a race**
  - **Symptom**: I issued `install "Telework Contract"` and `use-ability "Telework Contract"` in the same parallel batch; the ability call sometimes ran before the install was recognized (`Card not found installed`).
  - **Suggestion**:
    - In the tactical instructions, explicitly warn: **only parallelize read-only commands** (`status`, `prompt`, `log`, `hand`, `board`), never “write” actions.

- **Prompt API mismatches / inconsistent verbs**
  - **`discard` vs `choose-card`**: End-of-turn discard required `choose-card <index>`; using `discard "name"` failed.
  - **Run advancement**: Sometimes the correct action was `continue`, sometimes `wait-for-relevant-diff` was enough, and sometimes you have to `continue` again even after waiting.
  - **Suggestion**:
    - Add a small “prompt taxonomy” section:
      - **Select prompt with selectable cards**: use `choose-card`.
      - **Choice list prompt**: use `choose <index>`.
      - **Run windows**: usually `continue`, but when Corp has a rez/paid-ability decision, use cursor+wait, then `continue` again.

- **Raw Clojure map output (e.g. `Mutual Favor`)**
  - **Symptom**: `Mutual Favor` presented options as EDN-ish/Clojure maps including full card data.
  - **Impact**: Still usable, but increases cognitive load and makes it easier for an agent to mis-pick.
  - **Suggestion**:
    - Present *cleaned choices*:
      - `0. Carmen (Killer) - cost 5`
      - `1. Mayfly (AI) - cost 1`
      - `2. Cancel`
    - Keep the detailed map behind a `--verbose` flag.

- **Some status fields looked inconsistent**
  - I saw a couple moments where `status`/prompt didn’t perfectly match (e.g., “Not in a run” immediately after a run window message). I think this was more “state advanced between commands” than a real rules bug, but it made the agent cautious.
  - **Suggestion**: if feasible, include a monotonic state id in outputs and show it in every command response.

## Feedback on the tactical instructions (what worked, what I’d change)

- **What worked extremely well**
  - **Cursor + `wait-for-relevant-diff --since $CURSOR` pattern**: this was the single biggest enabler of fast play without hidden-info leaks. Great design.
  - **Emphasis on speed / taking actions rather than narrating**: good for this kind of UI.

- **What I’d add/change**
  - **Explicit “no parallel writes” rule**
    - Add a line like:
      - “You may batch `status/hand/board/log/prompt` in parallel; do not batch installs/plays/choices with anything else.”
  - **A “run resolver” mini-playbook**
    - Something like:
      1. `prompt`
      2. If run prompt says “use continue”: `continue`
      3. If monitor-run says waiting on Corp rez/paid window: `CURSOR=get-cursor`, then `wait-for-relevant-diff --since`
      4. On `decision-required`: choose `tank/jack-out` or break with `abilities` + `use-ability`
  - **Prompt command cheat-sheet**
    - A compact mapping of prompt types to commands (choose vs choose-card vs continue).
  - **Debug recovery**
    - If `send_command`/shell goes silent:
      - restart IDE
      - rerun `./dev/send_command runner status`
  - **Strategy note: tag punishment is real**
    - This game ended up hinging on tags (Retribution blew up my barrier breaker; losing Smartware and Cleaver changed the whole endgame). A short reminder like:
      - “If tagged and Corp has credits/cards, prioritize clearing tags unless you can win immediately.”
    - That said, your instructions already pointed in that direction; I’d just elevate it because it’s *the* tutorial gotcha.

If you want, I can turn the above into a concise PR-style checklist for the instructions doc (no code changes unless you ask).
