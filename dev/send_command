  score <name>    - Score agenda with sufficient advancement counters (Corp only)

${GREEN}Runner Actions:${NC}
  run <server> [flags] - Run on server (HQ, "R&D", Archives, remote1, etc.)

${GREEN}Run Automation:${NC}
  continue [flags]     - Auto-continue until decision required (see Prompts section)
  continue-run [flags] - (alias for 'continue --single') Single-step mode
  monitor-run [flags]  - (alias for 'continue') Loop mode

  ${BLUE}Run Flags:${NC} (usable with run, continue)
    --no-rez         Corp: don't rez any ICE (auto-decline all rez windows)
    --rez <name>     Corp: only rez ICE matching <name>, decline others
    --fire-unbroken  Corp: auto-fire unbroken subroutines

  ${BLUE}Card Selection Prompts:${NC} (prompt asks you to select a card)
  choose-card <N> - Select card N from the selectable cards (0 = first)
                     Use 'prompt' command to see what cards are selectable
  multi-choose <cards...> - Select MULTIPLE cards (for effects requiring several)
                     By name: multi-choose "Hedge Fund" "IPO"
                     By index: multi-choose 0 1 2

  ${BLUE}How to tell which to use:${NC}
  - Run 'prompt' to see the current prompt type and options
  - "choice" prompts → use choose/choose-value
  - "select" prompts → use choose-card (single) or multi-choose (multiple)
  continue [flags] - Auto-continue until decision required (default: loop mode)
                     --single  Single-step mode (one action, then return)
                     --raw     Raw WebSocket pass (debugging only)
  jack-out        - Jack out of current run (end run unsuccessfully)
  tank <ice-name> - Authorize letting subs fire on ICE, then continue run
                     Use when paused at "authorization required" for unbroken subs
  wait-for-diff [seconds] - Wait for game state change (shows recent log)
  wait-for-relevant-diff [seconds] [--since N] - Wait for relevant game events
                     Wakes on: runs starting/ending, prompts, your turn to act
                     Ignores: opponent credits, draws, minor actions
                     --since N: Pass cursor from previous action; returns immediately
                               if state already advanced (fixes race conditions)
                     Works for: AI-vs-AI, HITL testing, script automation
  wait-for-log-past <marker> [seconds] - Wait for log entries after marker text
  get-cursor          - Get current state cursor (for --since parameter)

${GREEN}Lobby:${NC}
  create-game <title> [side] [precon] [gateway-type]  - Create new game (gateway-type: Beginner|Intermediate)

${GREEN}Installation:${NC}
  install <name> <server> [--overwrite]  - Install card to server
                     Centrals: HQ, R&D, Archives (for ICE)
                     Remotes: "new" creates new, "Server 1" etc. must exist
                     Use --overwrite to replace existing asset/agenda
  install-index <N> [server] - Install card by index (Corp needs server)

${GREEN}Connection:${NC}
  connect         - Manually reconnect WebSocket to server

${GREEN}AI Bot:${NC}
  dashboard       - Corp: Show ranked heuristic options (all rules)
  dashboard-compact [N] - Corp: Show top N available options (default: 5)
  bot             - Corp: Make one heuristic decision and execute
  bot-turn        - Corp: Play full turn with heuristic AI

${GREEN}Advanced:${NC}
  eval <expr>     - Execute arbitrary Clojure expression
  debug-chat [on|off] - Toggle debug chat mode (waits announced in game chat)
                     Useful for HITL debugging - shows what AI is waiting for

${YELLOW}Turn Timing Quick Reference:${NC}
  ${BLUE}Corp Turn:${NC} gain clicks → draw card → take actions → discard to hand size
    • Use 'continue' to advance through paid ability windows
    • Clicks must be spent before end-turn
    • Discard happens before turn formally ends

  ${BLUE}Runner Turn:${NC} gain clicks → take actions → discard to hand size
    • No mandatory draw (unlike Corp)
    • Use 'continue' to advance through paid ability windows
    • Clicks must be spent before end-turn

  ${BLUE}Run Sequence:${NC} initiation → approach ice → encounter ice → movement → access/jack out
    • Runner: 'run <server>' auto-continues through unopposed runs
    • Corp: 'monitor-run' to participate (auto-continues, pauses at rez decisions)
    • Approach: Corp decides to rez ICE or decline (use 'rez <name>' or 'continue')
    • Encounter: Break subs with icebreakers (or let fire with 'let-subs-fire')
    • Access: 'choose-value steal/trash/"no action"' for each accessed card
    • Runs auto-pause at: rez decisions (Corp), trashable access, sub fire decisions

  ${BLUE}Common Stuck States:${NC}
    • Both at 0 clicks, no prompts → Use 'start-turn' to begin next turn
    • Run stopped → Check 'prompt' to see what decision is needed
    • Turn won't end → Check 'prompt' for blocking discard/ability prompts

${YELLOW}Examples:${NC}
  ./send_command status
  ./send_command list-lobbies
  ./send_command take-credit
  ./send_command play "Sure Gamble"
  ./send_command install "Daily Casts"
  ./send_command run "R&D"
  ./send_command choose 0
  ./send_command choose-value keep
  ./send_command end-turn
