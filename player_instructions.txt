# AI Player Game Reference

## Overview

This document describes the command interface for controlling the AI player in Netrunner via the `send_command` tool. It covers all available commands, game mechanics, and common workflows.

**Usage:**
```bash
./dev/send_command <side> <command> [arguments]
```
If you don't already have the help for send_command in context, you will want to run send_command <side> help to make sure you have the latest version and avoid document drift.

## Core Concepts

### Game Structure
- **Sides:** Corp (defending servers) vs Runner (attacking servers)
- **Resources:** Credits (money), Clicks (actions per turn)
- **Servers:** Corp installs cards in servers (HQ, R&D, Archives, Server 1-5)
- **Runs:** Runner attacks servers to access cards

### Turn Flow
1. Start turn (gain clicks, Corp draws mandatory card)
2. Take actions (play cards, install, take credits, make runs)
3. End turn (all clicks must be spent)

### Prompts
Many actions create prompts requiring responses:
- Mulligan (keep or redraw starting hand)
- Run phases (continue, jack out, break ICE)
- Card access (steal, trash, or leave)
- Discard to hand size (select cards to trash)
---

### Basic Click Actions

**Click for credit:**
```bash
./send_command take-credit
```
Spend 1 click, gain 1 credit

**Draw card:**
```bash
./send_command draw
```
Spend 1 click, draw 1 card

---

### Mulligan & Hand Management

**Keep starting hand:**
```bash
./send_command keep-hand
```

**Mulligan (redraw):**
```bash
./send_command mulligan
```

**Discard to hand size:**
```bash
./send_command discard
```
Auto-detects your side, discards from end of hand to reach maximum (usually 5 cards)

---

### Card Actions

**Play card by name:**
```bash
./send_command play "Sure Gamble"
```
Plays events (Runner) or operations (Corp)

**Play card by index:**
```bash
./send_command play-index 0
```
Index: 0-4 for cards in hand

**Install card:**
```bash
# Runner (no server needed):
./send_command install "Daily Casts"
./send_command install-index 0

# Corp (must specify server):
./send_command install "Palisade" "HQ"         # Protect HQ
./send_command install "Palisade" "New remote" # Create new remote server
./send_command install "PAD Campaign" "HQ"     # Install in HQ root
```

Corp server targets:
- `"HQ"`, `"R&D"`, `"Archives"` - Install ICE protecting central servers or assets in server root
- `"New remote"` - Create new remote server
- `"Server 1"`, `"Server 2"`, etc. - Existing remote servers

**Use installed card ability:**
```bash
./send_command use-ability "Smartware Distributor" 0
```
- `<name>` - Installed card name
- `<N>` - Ability index (use `abilities` command to see indices)

**Trash installed card:**
```bash
./send_command trash "Telework Contract"
```

**Rez card (Corp only):**
```bash
./send_command rez "Palisade"
```
Pay rez cost to flip ICE/asset/upgrade faceup

**Advance card (Corp only):**
```bash
./send_command advance "Project Atlas"
```
Spend 1 click and 1 credit to place advancement counter (for scoring agendas)

**Score agenda (Corp only):**
```bash
./send_command score "Project Atlas"
```
Score agenda when it has sufficient advancement counters

**Important Scoring Rules:**
- ⚠️ **Corp turn only** - Cannot score on Runner's turn (prevents "bait and score" strategies)
- ⚠️ **Does NOT cost a click** - Scoring happens at the end of a click action (e.g., after final advance)
- A 2-cost agenda can be fast-advanced in one turn: install-advance-advance-score (3 clicks)
- A 3-cost agenda requires 2 turns minimum (install + 3 advances) or effects (e.g. operations) that cheat advancement
- Some agendas have scoring effects that trigger prompts (e.g., "Send a Message" offers optional ICE rez)

---

#### Run Phase Sequence

A run is NOT a single action - it's a sequence of phases requiring responses:

**1. Initiation Phase**
```bash
./send_command run "R&D"
# Receive prompt: "Continue to Approach Server"
# Phase indicator: "Initiation"
```

**2. Approach ICE (if present)**
```bash
./send_command continue
# Corp gets opportunity to rez ICE
# Runner waits for Corp action
```

**ICE Positions (0-indexed):**
- Position 0 = outermost ICE (encountered first)
- Position 1 = second ICE from outside
- Position N = innermost ICE (encountered last)
- Game log shows: "approaches ice protecting HQ at position 0"

**3. Encounter ICE (if rezzed)**
Runner uses icebreakers to break subroutines:

**Option A: Full Break (auto-break)**
```bash
./send_command use-ability "Unity" 2  # "Fully break Whitespace"
./send_command continue               # Done breaking
```

**Option B: Partial Break (manual subroutine selection)**
```bash
./send_command use-ability "Unity" 0  # "Break 1 Code Gate subroutine"
# Prompt appears: "Break a subroutine"
# Choices:
#   0. [Subroutine 0 text]
#   1. [Subroutine 1 text]
#   2. Done
./send_command choose 0               # Break sub 0
./send_command choose 1               # Done breaking
./send_command continue               # Pass priority
```

**4. Corp fires unbroken subroutines**
```bash
./send_command fire-subs "Whitespace"
```

**5. Approach Server (if run not ended)**
```bash
./send_command continue
# Final continue before accessing cards
```

**6. Access Cards (breach)**
Prompts appear for each accessed card:
```bash
./send_command choose-value steal     # Steal agenda
./send_command choose-value trash     # Trash card (pay trash cost)
./send_command choose-value "no action"  # Leave card
```

**Jacking Out**

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Jack-out timing is restricted!**

You can ONLY jack out **AFTER passing ICE** (between pieces of stacked ICE), OR before final access, NOT during approach or encounter.

Legal jack-out windows:
- ✅ After passing ICE #1, before approaching ICE #2
- ✅ After passing all ICE, before accessing server
- ❌ During approach-ice phase
- ❌ During encounter-ice phase

```bash
# Example: Tactical jack-out after taking damage
./send_command run "R&D"
./send_command continue                    # Approach ICE #1
./send_command continue                    # Encounter ICE #1 (takes 4 net damage)
# ICE fires, you take damage but survive
./send_command continue                    # Pass ICE #1
# Now approaching ICE #2 which might flatline you
./send_command jack-out                    # ✅ Legal - save yourself!
```

**Common mistake:** Trying to jack out when you see dangerous ICE during approach. You MUST encounter it first, let subs fire, THEN jack out if still alive.

**Potential automation:** Jack-out legality could be checked automatically based on run phase:
- `run.phase` = "approach-ice" or "encounter-ice" → jack-out ILLEGAL
- `run.phase` = "movement" (between ICE) → jack-out LEGAL
- Server should enforce this, but worth validating before sending command

### Breaking ICE - Complete Guide

Breaking ICE is the core Runner skill. This section explains how breaker abilities work.

#### Breaker Types Must Match ICE Types

**The three types:**
| ICE Type   | Breaker Type | Example Breakers |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Barrier    | Fracter      | Cleaver, Paperclip |
| Code Gate  | Decoder      | Unity, Gordian Blade |
| Sentry     | Killer       | Carmen, Bukhgalter |

**AI breakers** (like Mayfly) can break any ICE type, but usually have a drawback (trash after use).

**Critical rule:** A Fracter cannot break Code Gates. A Killer cannot break Barriers. If you run with the wrong breaker, you cannot break the ICE.

#### Ability Indices During Encounters

When you encounter ICE, use `abilities "<breaker>"` to see available actions:

```bash
./send_command abilities "Cleaver"
```

**Outside a run (or wrong ICE type):**
```
[0] Break up to 2 Barrier subroutines  (1¢)
[1] Add 1 strength                      (2¢)
```

**During encounter with matching ICE type:**
```
[0] Break up to 2 Barrier subroutines  (1¢)
[1] Add 1 strength                      (2¢)
[2] Fully break Palisade               (1¢)   ← USE THIS
```

**During encounter when under-strength:**
```
[0] Break 1 subroutine                 (1¢)
[1] Add 1 strength                      (1¢)
[2] Match strength and fully break X   (2¢)   ← USE THIS
[3] Match strength of X                (1¢)
```

**Key insight:** If ability [2] doesn't appear, either:
1. You're not in an encounter phase, OR
2. Your breaker can't break this ICE type, OR
3. You can't afford the full break cost

**Cost gating:** The "Fully break" ability only appears if you can afford it. If it costs 3¢ and you have 2¢, the ability won't show - even if 2¢ would cover a partial break with ability [0]. Plan your credits before running.

#### The Recommended Workflow

**ALWAYS use the "Fully break" ability [2] when available:**

```bash
# 1. Start run
./send_command run "R&D"

# 2. Approach ICE (Corp may rez)
./send_command continue

# 3. Encounter ICE - CHECK ABILITIES
./send_command abilities "Cleaver"
# Look for "[2] Fully break <ICE>"

# 4. Use full break ability
./send_command use-ability "Cleaver" 2

# 5. Continue to pass priority
./send_command continue
```

This is cleaner, faster, and avoids timing issues.

#### Manual Breaking (Advanced/Situational)

Manual breaking is useful when you only want to break some subroutines (e.g., break "End the run" but let "Trace 2" fire because you're tagged anyway).

**Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Boost strength if needed
./send_command use-ability "Mayfly" 1      # +1 strength

# 2. Use base break ability
./send_command use-ability "Mayfly" 0      # "Break 1 subroutine"

# 3. Prompt appears: "Break a subroutine"
./send_command choose 0                     # Break first sub

# 4. If more subs to break, repeat steps 2-3
# 5. Continue to pass priority
./send_command continue
```

**Warning:** Manual breaking is error-prone. In our test game, using manual breaking led to Corp firing subs before all breaks were complete (timing issue). Use "Fully break" unless you have a specific reason.

#### Pre-Run Checklist

Before running, verify:

1. **What ICE is rezzed?**
   ```bash
   ./send_command board
   ```

2. **What type is each ICE?**
   ```bash
   ./send_command card-text "Palisade"
   # Output: ICE - Barrier
   ```

3. **Do I have matching breakers installed?**
   - Barrier → need Fracter
   - Code Gate → need Decoder
   - Sentry → need Killer

4. **Is my breaker strong enough?**
   - Breaker strength must be >= ICE strength
   - Check during encounter: abilities will show "Match strength" options if needed

#### ICE Breaking Examples

**Full Break (Unity vs Whitespace - Code Gate):**
```bash
./send_command run HQ
./send_command continue                    # Approach
./send_command continue                    # Encounter
./send_command use-ability "Unity" 2       # Fully break Whitespace
./send_command continue                    # Done breaking
./send_command continue                    # Proceed to access
```

**Partial Break (break only dangerous subs):**
```bash
./send_command run HQ
./send_command continue                    # Approach
./send_command continue                    # Encounter
./send_command use-ability "Unity" 0       # Break 1 subroutine
./send_command choose 0                    # Break sub 0
./send_command choose 1                    # Done (let sub 1 fire)
./send_command continue                    # Pass priority
# Corp fires remaining subs (likely ends run)
```

**Type Mismatch (code gate breaker vs barrier ICE):**
```bash
./send_command run "Server 1"
./send_command continue                    # Approach
# Corp rezzes Palisade (Barrier)
./send_command continue                    # Can't break with Unity (Code Gate breaker)
# Corp fires subs, run likely ends
```

**Key Insight:** Always use `card-text` command to check ICE type before running:
```bash
./send_command card-text "Tithe"
# Output: ICE - Sentry - AP
# Conclusion: Need sentry breaker, not barrier/code gate breaker
```

### Damage Mechanics

The Runner should consider their current handsize as akin to current health.
The Runner can take three types of damage:

**Net Damage:**
- Common source: Accessing traps and certain agendas
- Effect: Runner discards N cards at random from hand
- If unable to discard enough cards, Runner flatlines (loses game)
- Example: Urtica Cipher deals 2 net damage on access

**Meat Damage:**
- Common source: Corp operations and certain card abilities
- Effect: Identical to net damage (random discard)
- If unable to discard enough cards, Runner flatlines (loses game)

**Brain Damage:**
- Common source: Specific ICE subroutines and Corp cards
- Effect: Random discard PLUS permanent max hand size reduction
- Each point of brain damage permanently reduces max hand size by 1
- If unable to discard enough cards, Runner flatlines (loses game)

**Key Differences from End-of-Turn Discard:**
- Damage = **random discard** (no player choice)
- End-of-turn = **chosen discard** (player selects which cards)
- Damage can cause flatline if hand is empty
- Commands handle damage automatically (cards are randomly trashed)

---

### Prompts & Choices

**Choose by index:**
```bash
./send_command choose 0
./send_command choose 1
```
Use when you know the exact option number

**Choose by value (semantic selection):**
```bash
./send_command choose-value keep
./send_command choose-value steal
./send_command choose-value "jack out"
```
More intuitive, matches text partial and case-insensitive

**Continue/pass priority:**
```bash
./send_command continue
```
Used in:
- Paid ability windows
- Run phases (between approach/encounter/access)
- Passing when no actions to take

## Common Workflows

### Game Start Sequence

```bash
# Create game
./send_command create-game "Test Game" "Runner"

# Wait for opponent to join, then start
./send_command start-game

# Handle mulligan
./send_command keep-hand
# or
./send_command mulligan
```

### Basic Runner Turn

```bash
./send_command start-turn

# Play economy card
./send_command play "Sure Gamble"

# Install program/resource
./send_command install "Daily Casts"

# Spend remaining clicks
./send_command take-credit
./send_command take-credit

./send_command end-turn
```

### Basic Corp Turn

```bash
./send_command start-turn
# (Automatically drew mandatory card)

# Install ICE
./send_command install "Palisade" "HQ"

# Install agenda
./send_command install "Project Atlas" "New remote"

# Spend remaining clicks
./send_command take-credit

./send_command end-turn
```

### Making a Run

```bash
# Check board state first
./send_command board
./send_command card-text "Tithe"  # Check ICE type if unknown

# Start run
./send_command run "R&D"

# Respond to prompts
./send_command continue           # Pass initiation
./send_command continue           # Approach ICE
# (Corp rezzes or continues)
./send_command use-ability "Cleaver" 0  # Break if barrier
./send_command choose 0           # Select sub to break
./send_command choose 1           # Done breaking
./send_command continue           # Pass priority

# Access cards
./send_command choose-value steal # Steal agenda if found
```

### Corp Scoring Agenda

```bash
# Advance agenda (repeat 3x for 3/2 agenda)
./send_command advance "Project Atlas"
./send_command advance "Project Atlas"
./send_command advance "Project Atlas"

# Score (if sufficient advancement)
./send_command score "Project Atlas"
```

## Technical Notes

### Server Name Format
Always use exact game format:
- **Central servers:** `"HQ"`, `"R&D"`, `"Archives"`
- **Remote servers:** `"Server 1"`, `"Server 2"`, `"Server 3"`, etc.
- **Install targets:** `"New remote"` to create new remote

### Timing
Commands are sent to a persistent REPL maintaining WebSocket connection. Allow 1-2 seconds for server responses between commands in rapid sequences.

### UUID Handling
Game IDs are UUIDs. Copy exact format from `list-lobbies` output:
```
1806d5c9-f540-4158-ab66-8182433dcf10
```

### Error Recovery
If connection drops:
```bash
./send_command connect
./send_command resync <game-id>
```

### Advanced Usage
Execute arbitrary Clojure in the AI client REPL:
```bash
./send_command eval '(println "Debug:" @ws/client-state)'
```

## Appendix: Official Timing Structures

These timing structures are taken from the official Netrunner rules. Understanding these helps debug stuck states and timing-dependent interactions.

### Corporation Turn (Rule 5.6)

**5.6.1: Draw Phase**
- a) Corporation gains allotted clicks (default: 3)
- b) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards or score agendas during this window
- c) Corporation recurring credits refill
- d) The turn formally begins. Turn begins events resolve
- e) The corporation performs their mandatory draw
- f) Proceed to the action phase (5.6.2)

**5.6.2: Action Phase**
- a) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards or score agendas during this window
- b) If the corporation has unspent clicks, they take an action
- c) If an action occurred, return to (a)
- d) The action phase is complete. Proceed to the discard phase (5.6.3)

**5.6.3: Discard Phase**
- a) The corporation discards to maximum hand size, if applicable
- b) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards during this window
- c) If the corporation has any clicks remaining, they lose those clicks
- d) The Corporation's turn formally ends. Turn end triggers resolve
- e) Proceed to the Runner turn

### Runner Turn (Rule 5.7)

**5.7.1: Action Phase**
- a) Runner gains allotted clicks (default: 4)
- b) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards
- c) Runner recurring credits refill
- d) The turn formally begins. Turn begins events resolve
- e) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards
- f) If the Runner has unspent clicks, they take an action
- g) If an action occurred, return to (e)
- h) The action phase is complete. Proceed to the discard phase (5.7.2)

**5.7.2: Discard Phase**
- a) The runner discards to maximum hand size, if applicable
- b) Paid ability window. Corp may rez non-ice cards
- c) If the runner has any clicks remaining, they lose those clicks
- d) The Runner's turn formally ends. Turn end triggers resolve
- e) Proceed to the Corporation turn

### Run Timing Structure (Rule 6.9)

**6.9.1: Initiation Phase**
- a) Runner declares a server
- b) Runner gains Bad Publicity credits
- c) Run formally begins - Run events fire
- d) Paid Ability Window. Corp may rez non-ice cards during this window
- e) Proceed to the outermost ice, if applicable, and begin the approach phase (6.9.2)
- f) Otherwise, proceed to the movement phase (6.9.4)

**6.9.2: Approach Ice Phase**
- a) You are now approaching the ice. Approach events resolve
- b) Paid Ability Window. Corp may rez the approached ice, or non-ice cards, during this window
- c) If approached ice is rezzed, continue to encounter phase (6.9.3)
- d) Otherwise, proceed to the movement phase (6.9.4)

**6.9.3: Encounter Ice Phase**
- a) You are now encountering this ice. Encounter events resolve
- b) Paid ability window. Encountered ice may be interfaced during this window
- c) If there are unbroken subroutines to resolve, the corporation resolves the topmost unbroken subroutine. If they do, repeat this step
- d) The encounter is complete. Proceed to the movement phase (6.9.4)

**6.9.4: Movement Phase**
- a) If you were encountering or approaching an ice, you pass it. Pass-Ice events resolve
- b) If there are no more ice inwards from the passed ice, 'when you pass all ice on the server' events resolve
- c) Paid ability window
- d) The runner may jack out. If they do, proceed to the run ends phase (6.9.6)
- e) The runner proceeds to the next position inwards, if applicable
- f) Paid ability window. The corporation may rez non-ice cards
- g) If you are approaching another ice, return to the approach ice phase (6.9.2)
- h) The runner approaches the attacked server. Approach events resolve
- i) Continue to the success phase (6.9.5)

**6.9.5: Success Phase**
- a) The run is declared successful. Successful run events are met
- b) The runner breaches the attacked server
- c) The success phase is complete. Continue to the run ends phase (6.9.6)

**6.9.6: Run Ends Phase**
- a) Any open priority windows complete or are closed
- b) The runner loses any unspent bad publicity credits
- c) If the success phase was not reached and the server still exists, the run becomes unsuccessful
- d) The run ends. Run ends events resolve

**Key Timing Insights:**
- Paid ability windows occur between almost every action
- `continue` command advances through paid ability windows
- Jack out is ONLY legal at 6.9.4.d (movement phase)
- Discard happens BEFORE turn end (5.6.3.a, 5.7.2.a)
- Clicks are lost in discard phase if unspent (5.6.3.c, 5.7.2.c)
